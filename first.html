<p id="note-1"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">1. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from the Prelude
  here <a href="assets/PF-01.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-1"></a>. It
  forms a marked contrast with Davies' choice of opening to Episode 1 <a href="SS.html#The-Prelude" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-1"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-2"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">2. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  1 here <a href="assets/PF-02.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-2"></a>. The narrator gives ironic
  consideration to why a girl like Dorothea might be considered a challenging choice
  of wife or why she might decide not to marry..</p>


<p id="note-3"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">3. View the opening sequence which is pure invention by Andrew Davies <a href="assets/F-02.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-3"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-4"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">4. A handdrawn stagecoach is the primary image on the Block 1 Production schedule
  cover. In a witty parallel with Lydgate and his optimism for his new venture, the

  image depicts the production team riding into town with all their 'Props', 'Frocks'
  'Design' 'Camera' and 'V/X' luggage aboard. In fact, this first block of shooting
  (1 March-9 April 1993),
  covered many of the country house scenes. The Stamford shoot for the Middlemarch town
  scenes formed Block 3 in July and August 1993 <a href="image.html?asset=PM-01.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-4"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-5"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">5. Lydgate's first line the Post-production script is an imperative addressed to his

  fellow travellers. Even at this point he is making his views felt and pointing to
  the advent of change.
  Compare with his first line in the Shooting script, 'The future.' addressed to himself
  <a href="SS.html#Lydgates-first-line" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-5"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-6"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">6. Davies' stage direction which others the navvies (the agents of change) as
  'huge terrible half naked monsters' is not followed through in the screen version
  of this scene
  where the railway layers are clothed and unthreatening.</p>


<p id="note-7"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">7. Scheduling the appearance and filming of the horses was a complex job
  in itself as Production Manager Julie Edwards explains <a href="assets/I-03-T-01.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-7"></a><a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/104" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-7"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-8"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">8. Lydgate enters Middlemarch for the first time,as captured during the
  shooting of this scene <a href="image.html?asset=P-10.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-8"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-9"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">9. Omitted from the Post-production script but present in the screen version is
  Lydgate tipping the stage coach man as he hands him his minimal luggage 'Here's your
  bag'. This
  removes the need for the inn keeper's assistant to take the bag.</p>


<p id="note-10"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">10. The inn keeper's confident identification of Lydgate indicates he is expected

  and the only gentleman stranger to step down from the coach. The Post-production script
  has finessed
  the inn keeper's line to a more tentative question to Lydgate. His subsequent speech
  brings the
  'welcome' and provides exposition for the viewer that Lydgate will replace Dr Peacock
  in Middlemarch <a href="PP.html#innkeeper-identifies-Lydgate" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-10"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-11"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">11. The White Hart pub sign that blows in the breeze above Lydgate's head
  started as Gerry Scott's black-and-white sketch <a href="image.html?asset=PM-47.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-11"></a>
  with this note inscribed by her on the back to the person granting sign-off regarding
  the
  nature of the final backdrop to the image <a href="image.html?asset=PM-48.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-11"></a> <a href="assets/pm-48-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-11"></a>.
  The finished image reveals the skill and attention to detail given to the design and

  realisation of each prop produced for the adaptation <a href="image.html?asset=PM-49.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-11"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-12"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">12. A key minor figure, Mawmsey the grocer, is established with this panning shot

  representing Lydgate's point of view as he takes his first look along Middlemarch's
  main street.</p>


<p id="note-13"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">13. In interview, Director of the production, Anthony Page reflects on Davies' adaptive
  style which is to relay events in a more 'direct and popular and modern' way.
  He comments that to have employed a narrator figure in the dramatisation may have
  worked on stage to give a more literary feel <a href="image.html?asset=PM-79.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-13"></a>
  <a href="assets/pm-79-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-13"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-13"></a>. Davies himself puts forward his
  vision for dramatising <em>Middlemarch</em> for 'a 1990s audience' in an early letter to Michael Wearing - Head of BBC Drama
  serials - in 1991 <a href="image.html?asset=PM-100.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-13"></a>
  <a href="assets/PM-100-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-13"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/104" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-13"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-14"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">14. Anthony Page explains, in interview, the challenge of casting Dorothea because
  of her more intangible qualities some of which are referenced in Andrew Davies'
  stage direction introducing Dorothea in Scene 1/3. Page also reflects on how Juliet
  Aubrey suited the role <a href="image.html?asset=PM-82.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-14"></a>
  <a href="assets/pm-82-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-14"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-14"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-15"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">15. In interview, Lighting cameraman, Brian Tufano describes the three vantage points
  from which the cameras captured this riding scene and effects he created through
  these choices <a href="image.html?asset=PM-95.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-15"></a> <a href="assets/pm-95-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-15"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-15"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-16"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">16. The Post-production script adds this line for Celia to show the
  sisters have been out riding for leisure for some time and will be expected back at

  Tipton. Celia's laughter is infectious and as they gallop home, Dorothea joins her

  in laughing freely - not signalled here in Davies' stage directions.</p>


<p id="note-17"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">17. Celia's additional line in the Post-production script both encourages
  Dorothea to ride on and shows she is not as concerned with the poor family's plight

  as Dorothea.</p>


<p id="note-18"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">18. Culverthorpe Hall in Lincolnshire was the setting for Tipton Grange - the home

  of the Brooke's. This view of Culverthorpe Hall shows the stable block on the far
  left where in Scene 1/Celia and Dorothea
  leave their horses to the groom after their ride <a href="image.html?asset=P-220.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-18"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-19"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">19. This is the moment where Davies has Dorothea decide to give up
  riding. There is a source for this in the novel <a href="NO.html#Dorothea-riding" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-19"></a>.
  The script is abbreviated in the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#Dorothea-riding-in-PP" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-19"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-20"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">20. Davies' interpretations of characters, such as this first comment
  on Brooke, often disappear from stage directions between the Shooting script and the
  Post-production
  script. In this case this and the camera shot to the sisters from Brooke's point of
  view is replaced
  by a direction for Brooke's speech to cut 'across this' shot of the sisters. <a href="PP.html#Brooke-SD-change-1" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-20"></a></p>


<p id="note-21"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">21. There is a longer commentary on these opening scenes, and the Lydgate market
  walk scene <a href="CO.html#comment-50" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-21"></a> that was inserted in the Post-production script,
  here <a href="PP.html#Lyd-market-walk" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-21"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-22"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">22. Roach, Brooke's Steward, ad lib's an extra line in the Post-production script
  -
  a pragmatic decision to allow the two characters to exit Scene 1/6, but it also hints
  at the worse
  consequences of Brooke's inaction, caused by not spending a few shilings on repairs.</p>


<p id="note-23"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">23. A significant reordering of scenes here: the Shooting script carries on with the

  Dorothea plot for a further four lengthy scenes; instead the Post-production script
  locates five short scenes
  here establishing Lydgate's early days as a doctor in Middlemarch and his relationships
  with Farebrother
  and Bulstrode <a href="PP.html#five-scenes-Lydgates-early-prof-life-in-Mm" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-23"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-24"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">24. A new scene in the Post-production script. This simple stage direction is
  transformed into a tour of the noisy and vibrant Middlemarch market square in the
  onscreen version.
  The sights and sounds of the market envelope Lydgate as he walks through it.</p>


<p id="note-25"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">25. An extra scene in the Post-production script, signalled by the 'a' of Scene 1/19a;

  conveys a quick indication of Lydgate's solitary studious homelife.</p>


<p id="note-26"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">26. There is a longer commentary on this scene, termed by Andrew Davies the jewellery

  scene, here <a href="CO.html#comment-51" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-26"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-27"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">27. Note how the lighting moves from afternoon to dusk in the onscreen version of

  Scene 1/7 <a href="assets/F-03.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-27"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-28"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">28. Dorothea's opening speech is more deliberate in the Shooting script - asking
  Celia to come and look at her plans and showing how important they are to her with
  the need to 'do
  this right'. The equivalent speech in the Post-production script is simpler and her
  concern is over the
  size of the fireplaces not their proportion <a href="PP.html#fireplaces-jewellery-scene" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-28"></a>. The
  screen version aids this with a close-up of the cottage plans themselves. None of
  this detail of the plans
  is considered in the novel <a href="NO.html#plans-jewellery-scene" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-28"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-29"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">29. Costume designer, Anushia Nieradzik, describes in interview how she begins the
  design process by
  discussing costumes with the actors playing each role and how important the idea of
  the right silhouette is to her designs <a href="image.html?asset=PM-83.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-29"></a>
  <a href="assets/pm-83-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-29"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-29"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-30"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">30. Celia's move to persuade Dorothea to take the cross necklace is misjudged. Dorothea

  cannot think of wearing this emblem as an ornament and dismisses the necklace as a
  'trinket'. There is a
  source for this in the novel <a href="NO.html#Dorothea-the-cross-necklace" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-30"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-31"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">31. Davies notes in his letter to the first producer attached to the <em>Middlemarch</em>
  series, David Snodin, regarding a very early draft of this scene that, amongst several
  other implications
  a strong revelation within it is a sensual awakening in the two sisters and their
  differing responses to this <a href="image.html?asset=PM-50.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-31"></a>
  <a href="assets/pm-50-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-31"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/C/01" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-31"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-32"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">32. Davies takes this speech almost verbatim from the novel, so powerfully does it
  convey
  Dorothea's sensuous reaction to the emeralds. Note however that the ellipses denote
  dramatic pauses rather
  than omissions from dialogue in the novel. Davies most significant omission is Dorothea's
  biblical reference
  to 'gems being emblems in the Revelation of St John' <a href="NO.html#gems-Revelation" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-32"></a>. Eliot implies
  has Dorothea explore this spiritual allusion, one means by which her character tries
  to suppress the sensual.</p>


<p id="note-33"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">33. In interview, Lighting cameraman Brian Tufano explains how the lighting effect
  he creates at this point in the scene seeks to enhance
  the verbal narrative through a visual narrative <a href="image.html?asset=PM-94.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-33"></a> <a href="assets/PM-94-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-33"></a>
  <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-33"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-34"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">34. In the novel, Dorothea's final objection to accepting the jewels is caused by
  the misery and
  materiality she recalls will have gone into their mining, manufacture and sale <a href="NO.html#miserable-men" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-34"></a>. She overrides this objection
  on the proviso that she will keep only these two items. Davies chooses to omit this
  objection from his dialogue,
  which could be seen to relate to colonialism, as it does not inhibit Dorothea's decision.</p>


<p id="note-35"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">35. The final line in the Shooting script reflects the novel where Dorothea is still
  unsure
  she has done the right thing in accepting the emeralds and is uncertain about wearing
  them publicly; this comes
  across to Celia as a sharp comment <a href="NO.html#Dorotheas-sharp-end-comment-on-jewels" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-35"></a>. In contrast,
  this line is cut from the Post-production script and the scene ends with Dorothea
  saying perhaps she will wear
  the gems. <a href="PP.html#Dorotheas-conciliatory-comment-on-gems" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-35"></a></p>


<p id="note-36"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">36. Director, Anthony Page explains in interview why he considered Casaubon to be
  the most difficult
  part to cast in the adaptation and how he had to work hard around Patrick Malahide's
  availability once he was cast
  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-81.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-36"></a> <a href="assets/PM-81-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-36"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-36"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-37"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">37. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  2 here <a href="assets/PF-03.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-37"></a>.
  The narrator comments ironically on how great inferences are drawn from small comments
  during a courtship that is usually too
  short to get to know a future partner well. The Shooting script marks Dorothea's gratitude
  and pleasure at Casaubon's defence of
  her position. She's moved and impressed. <a href="SS.html#pilulous-smallness" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-37"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-38"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">38. In Chapter 2 of the novel, this conversation takes place just between these three
  characters at the
  tea table in the drawing room after dinner. This makes Casaubon's defence of Dorothea
  more pointed against
  Sir James <a href="NO.html#Casaubon-defends-Dorothea" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-38"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-39"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">39. Scene 1/9 only exists in the Shooting script. Here Davies summarises the talk
  between Celia and
  Dorothea from Chapter II, when they are in the drawing-room alone after dinner, but
  he sets this scene more intimately
  in Dorothea's bedroom where the sisters' thoughts clash over Casaubon. Celia focuses
  on his appearance, particularly
  the 'two big moles with hairs sprouting out of them' on his face while Dorothea concentrates
  on his 'great soul'.
  While Scene 1/9 is absent from the Post-production script, it makes strong references
  to the equivalent conversation
  in the novel <a href="NO.html#Casaubon-two-moles-great-soul" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-39"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-40"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">40. The long scene in the Shooting script is split into Scenes 1/11 and 1/11a in the
  Post-production
  script <a href="PP.html#Dorothea-Casaubon-first-talk-Tipton" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-40"></a>. These depict the discussion first about scholarship
  and then shared possibilities between Dorothea and Casaubon in two separate garden
  locations at Tipton. This better
  represents the fact that in Chapter III of the novel their conversation takes place
  over walks on two consecutive days
  of Casaubon's visit <a href="NO.html#Dorothea-Casaubon-first-walk-Tipton" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-40"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-41"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">41. The focus on Dorothea's eager response is reflected in the screen version of Scene
  1/11a when as
  Casaubon speaks of his visit being 'more than pleasant' the camera gradually moves
  in on her, capturing more of her
  ardent feeling.</p>


<p id="note-42"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">42. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  3 here <a href="assets/PF-04.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-42"></a>.
  The narrator guides the reader not to judge Dorothea's interpretations of Casaubon's
  knowledge and in the process casts slight doubt
  over the wisdom she ascribes to him. Andrew Davies reflects these interpretations
  of Casaubon in Shooting script Scene 1/11

<p id="note-43"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">43. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  3 here <a href="assets/PF-05.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-43"></a> The
  narrator dwells on the fact that the court of public opinion would not understand
  Dorothea's unconventional notions of marriage. Andrew Davies' equivalent
  to Dorothea's walk with Monk is the farewell to Casaubon in Shooting script Scene
  1/12<a href="SS.html#Dorothea-starry-eyed" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-43"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-44"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">44. The Post-production script indicates that that incidental music IM2A/D flows across

  Scenes 1/11, 1/11a and 1/12 unifying them. It might suggest Dorothea's growing hopes
  and feelings towards Casaubon as
  its cor anglais-led theme reaches a gentle cresendo when she contemplates his departing
  carriage.</p>


<p id="note-45"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">45. Production designer, Gerry Scott reveals in interview that the Old Infirmary ward
  was one of only a few interior sets that her team could not
  find locations for in Stamford because of the size of space required <a href="image.html?asset=PM-88.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-45"></a>

<p id="note-46"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">46. Lydgate's first speech in the hospital ward reveals his resistance to traditional
  purging for
  newer thought on treating fever <a href="PP.html#nurse-purging" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-46"></a>. Davies conveys that being in favour of progress
  goes hand-in-hand with Lydgate's idealism. Later in this scene he talks disparagingly
  of Trawley, a doctor acquaintance,
  who has sold out and rejected his youthful ideals. There is a source for this in the
  novel but it comes in Chapter 12
  where Lydgate dines at Farebrother's <a href="NO.html#Trawley-anecdote" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-46"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-47"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">47. The longer Shooting script Scene 1/13 is split here in the Post-production script
  to exit
  Lydgate and Farebrother from the hospital ward to the cloister in Scene 1/13a <a href="PP.html#split-scene-1.13a" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-47"></a> where they talk more
  privately of Trawley, and which leads them to meet Bulstrode. The scenes transition
  neatly from the hospital interior contructed in the gym at Stamford
  College to the exterior cloister set at Browne's Hospital, Stamford <a href="image.html?asset=P-223.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-47"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-48"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">48. Andrew Davies invents this linking scene to transport Lydgate with Bulstrode to
  the bank for their
  meeting about the hospital that occurs in Chapter 13 of the novel <a href="NO.html#linking-scene-1-14b" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-48"></a>. His casual stage
  direction in the Shooting script is followed through in the screened version, with
  Bulstrode and Lydgate's conversation being
  played over their walk down the High Street to the bank. Davies influences the set
  up of this scene with this comment but and
  his direction disappears by the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#missing-casual-AD-SD" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-48"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-49"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">49. Hawley's hawkish line in the Shooting script - observing that Lydgate is already
  in Bulstrode's pocket
  - is omitted from the Post-production script. Perhaps due to this scene being moved
  forward in the episode from its original location
  in the Shooting script making it too soon for this criticism of Lydgate to begin <a href="PP.html#Hawleys-hawkish-comment" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-49"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-50"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">50. Examining the plans for the new hospital is not part of the meeting with Bulstrode
  in Chapter 13. Davies
  introduces this visual element in Scene 1/15 to show Lydgate's enthusiasm for the
  physical manifestation of his medical ambition.
  A stronger link between this and Dorothea's parallel enthusiasm when drawing up plans
  for the new cottages is made in the Post-production
  script where Dorothea's Scene 1/7 is positioned adjacent to Lydgate's Scene 1/15 <a href="PP.html#Dors_excitement-over-plans" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-50"></a>. The
  adaptation uses this visual cue of the plans to link the idealist spirit of Eliot's
  protagonists <a href="PP.html#excitement-over-plans" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-50"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-51"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">51. The Shooting script reflects much more of the longer conversation between Bulstrode
  and Lydgate from Chapter 13
  where they discuss the kind of opposition that Lydgate will face in Middlemarch to
  his reformist attitudes to medical practice
  <a href="NO.html#medical-opposition" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-51"></a>. However, this is lost from the Post-production script in favour perhaps of progressing

  more swiftly to discussion of the election of the hospital chaplaincy. Bringing Scene
  1/15 forward in the episode may also have made
  it to early to introduce the idea of opposition to Lydgate <a href="PP.html#medical-opposition-omitted" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-51"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-52"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">52. Davies uses the device of the plans again, this time as Lydgate's means of deflecting
  the conversation that
  Bulstrode wishes to open about the appointment of Tyke and the 'spirtual life' of
  patients at the new hospital. In the novel Lydgate
  engages slightly more in this topic but is then relieved from talking further by Mr
  Vincy's arrival to plead with Bulstrode for Fred's
  letter <a href="NO.html#Lydgate-engages-more" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-52"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-53"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">53. Bulstrode soft, inherently threatening tone, referred to in Chapter 13 of the
  novel, is carried through by Davies
  into the stage direction at this point <a href="NO.html#Bulstrodes-tone" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-53"></a> as an significant and effective part of his characterisation.
  It leaves Lydgate feeling 'rather startled' as this latent forcefulness in Bulstrode
  comes to the surface and is well delivered by Peter Jeffrey
  in his onscreen performance.</p>


<p id="note-54"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">54. Scene 1/16 is invented for the Shooting script as a bridging scene between Lydgate's
  meeting with
  Bulstrode over the hospital drawings and his plans to study that evening being changed
  by Farebrother's dinner invitation.
  This order is changed in the Post-production script with several scenes in the Dorothea-Casaubon
  plot interrupting Lydgate's
  Scenes 1/15 and 1/16 <a href="PP.html#scene-1-16-comes-later" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-54"></a>. The effect is to suggest that more time has elapsed between
  these scenes. This brings it closer to the novel, as several chapters come between
  Bulstrode's meeting with Lydgate and Farebrother's
  dinner with Lydgate where his vote for the hospital chaplaincy is discussed.</p>


<p id="note-55"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">55. This scene also establishes the Green Dragon as a key location for action and
  gossip in Middlemarch. The Stamford residence
  used for the pub exterior <a href="image.html?asset=P-226.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-55"></a> with its distinctive arched doorway and half-boarded windows as Davies' stage directions

  suggest act as the 'only light in the darkness' for Lydgate on his way home. Farebrother
  is also seen exiting the pub in Scene 1/18a of the Post-Production script <a href="PP.html#Fare-exits-GD" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-55"></a>.
  At this point the three signs designed by Production designer, Gerry Scott for the
  Green Dragon, including the one for 'Good Billiards', so relevant to these scenes,
  can be seen clearly in shot
  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-11.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-55"></a> <a href="image.html?asset=PM-12.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-55"></a> <a href="image.html?asset=PM-14.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-55"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-56"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">56. Production designer, Gerry Scott reveals in interview that the Green Dragon inn
  was one of only a few interior sets
  that her team could not find locations for in Stamford because of the need for a separate
  billiards room <a href="image.html?asset=PM-88.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-56"></a>
  <a href="assets/PM-88-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-56"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-56"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-57"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">57. Scene 1/17 is another innovation of Davies to introduce the lower echelons of
  Middlemarch society, Fred
  Vincy and the theme of his mounting debts. Davies' stage directions have Fred 'standing
  cue in hand' watching Farebrother play in
  both scripts, but by the time this scene is filmed, the first thing the audience sees
  is Fred failing to pot a ball. This visual
  change is a far stronger cue to how his luck will run for much of the novel. This
  slightly careworn first appearance of Fred in
  the adaptation contrasts with the more assured Fred that Eliot introduces first at
  the Vincy breakfast in Chapter 12.</p>


<p id="note-58"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">58. Mrs Dollop is not mentioned in the Shooting script for Scene 1/17. She has morphed
  from the novel, where
  she is landlady of The Tankard, Middlemarch's lowest ranking public house, to become
  landlady of The Green Dragon in Davies' adaptation.
  She makes an early appearance here, not being present in Eliot's novel until Chapter
  45 where is introduced as a woman 'trechant' in
  her assertions <a href="NO.html#trenchant-assertion" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-58"></a>. This is the tone that Davies strikes with her first lines of dialogue in Scene 1/17.</p>


<p id="note-59"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">59. Whereas his winnings are collected from the table in the Shooting script, Farebrother
  has to come to Bambridge
  to collect them in the Post-production script, Fred having already been called over.
  Visually this is more powerful as they are handed
  over directly in front of the seated Fred. Bambridge is effectively given more agency
  in this final adaptation of the scene <a href="PP.html#collecting-winnings" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-59"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-60"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">60. Third in a sequence of scenes that Davies inserts to bring Lydgate to dine at
  Farebrother's, Scene 1/18 in
  the Shooting script is set on the town bridge. Lydgate is alone, still a newcomer
  to Middlemarch, when Farebrother catches up with
  him. In contrast, by the Post-production script, although alone, he is looking in
  the shop windows on the High Street <a href="PP.html#jewellers-window" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-60"></a>. Lydgate's invitation to
  Farebrother's is pre-arranged in the novel, not the spontaneous thing it is in Davies'
  script <a href="NO.html#Farebrother-invitation" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-60"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-61"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">61. The overhead night-time set-up for Scene 1/18b is captured in this on-location
  shot <a href="image.html?asset=P-126.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-61"></a>.
  Douglas Hodge (Lydgate) and Simon Chandler(Farebrother) can be seen bottom right speaking
  with Director, Anthony Page.</p>


<p id="note-62"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">62. Andrew Davies omits Farebrother's dependants - his mother,
  aunt and sister - from the Shooting script and opens Scene 1/19 with the dicussion
  between Lydgate and Farebrother. Eliot characterises
  the relationship between Farebrother and his female relations in the preceding conversation
  over dinner <a href="NO.html#Farebrother-family" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-62"></a>.
  Farebrother' Mother and aunt are reinstated in the Post-production script at start
  of Scene 1/19 <a href="PP.html#Farebrother-family-reinstated" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-62"></a>.
  View the onscreen version of this after-dinner scene, here <a href="assets/F-06.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-62"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-63"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">63. Lydgate's speech is refined between the Shooting script and the Post-production
  script:
  the direct comparison between Middlemarch and London is jettisoned and Lydgate's 'bleeding'
  and 'medicines of dubious value'
  become 'panaceas that are as useful as bottles of ditchwater', creating both a higher
  registed to his language and his medical
  understanding <a href="PP.html#panaceas" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-63"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-64"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">64. This idea of his research being more fruitful in Middlemarch develops in the Post-production
  script
  to Lydgate expressing that fact that he will have more freedom to do work here than
  in the city. No one will be watching
  him <a href="PP.html#noone-watching" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-64"></a>. Davies simply conveys here how wrong Lydgate's initial reading of this provincial
  town is.
  This part of the discussion in not held in the novel between Farebrother and Lydgate.
  Instead Davies has drawn the idea from
  Lydgate's conversation with Bulstrode about the new hospital in Chapter 13 <a href="NO.html#freedom-of-provinces" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-64"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-65"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">65. Scene 1/20 in the Shooting script is conflated into a longer Scene 1/19 in the
  Post-production
  script. Farebrother and Lydgate remain indoors rather than finishing their late-night
  conversation walking Lydgate back
  to his lodgings. Combining the two scenes also allows for a smoother transition to
  Farebrother's gentle warning to Lydgate
  about the nature of Middlemarchers <a href="PP.html#Farebrothers-warning" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-65"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-66"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">66. Davies retains much of Farebrother's speech from the end of Chapter 17 in the
  novel to show that he is a man
  who works for the good of the community rather than adopting ideas that would help
  him improve his own situation. But that he will
  understand if Lydgate has to take that road <a href="NO.html#neighbours-uncomfortable" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-66"></a>. However, he does combine two Farebrother
  speeches from the Shooting script into one in the Post-production script, to deliver
  these points more
  concisely <a href="PP.html#people-uncomfortable" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-66"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-67"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">67. There is a longer commentary on Scenes 1/19-20, here <a href="CO.html#comment-80" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-67"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-68"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">68. View this scene as it was shot by cinematographer Brian Tufano<a href="assets/F-10.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-68"></a>.
  The following interview extract offers further insights into the lighting techniques
  Tufano uses for this on-location interior
  <a href="assets/pm-53-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-68"></a>. A plan of the lighting for this scene further illustrates Tufano's comments
  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-54.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-68"></a>, together with a image of the scissor-lift lighting platform he mentions
  <a href="image.html?asset=P-203.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-68"></a> .</p>


<p id="note-69"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">69. Andrew Davies simplifies the Vincy family - the TV audience only ever meet or
  hear about the elder
  siblings, Rosamond and Fred. In the novel Eliot tells the reader that Bob, the second
  son, has already gone to work with
  Mr Vincy and the younger daughters are in the school-room at this time in the morning
  <a href="NO.html#younger-Vincys" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-69"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-70"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">70. Rosamond is here noted as sitting in an 'adjacent room'; whereas in the novel
  and Shooting script, she
  is seated within the Vincy's combined Breakfast and sitting room <a href="NO.html#Ros-embroidering" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-70"></a>. Such a change could derive
  from the choice of location for the Vincy house in Stamford in 1993 - the layout of
  the rooms at 3 All Saints' Place as shown in this
  location shot <a href="image.html?asset=P-150.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-70"></a>. But this set arrangement also sets Rosamond apart from the debris of the family
  breakfast,
  enagaged in the ladylike leisure activity of painting <a href="SS.html#Ros-in-adjacent-room" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-70"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-71"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">71. On screen, Mrs Vincy's needlework is a piece of mending, marking it out as more
  practical than Rosamond's decorative artwork.
  Also noteworthy is that the direct quotation from Chapter 12 <a href="NO.html#Mrs-Vincy-good-humour" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-71"></a> guiding delivery of the line, about
  Mrs Vincy's good humour and good looks for her age, that Davies includes in his Shooting
  script is omitted here in favour of the stage direction
  to return to her needlework <a href="SS.html#Mrs-Vincy-mending" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-71"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-72"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">72. The way that the colours and choices of the fabrics for Rosamond and Mrs Vincy's
  costumes are complementary to one another
  and to the decor of the Vincy sitting room is no accident. In interview, costume designer,
  Anushia Nierdzik explains how she matches the colours of her costumes
  both to the characters and their surroundings, as part of the colour palette for each
  home or location <a href="image.html?asset=PM-84.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-72"></a>
  <a href="assets/pm-84-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-72"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-72"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-73"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">73. Andrew Davies preserves the difference in register that Eliot initiates in the
  way Rosamond addresses Mrs Vincy as
  'Mamma' but Fred calls her 'Mother'. Fred hangs on to some of the terms from his family's
  lower-class roots whereas Rosamond has
  had them drilled out of her at Mrs Lemon's school. Differences in the ways the brother
  and sister speak help to convey their attitudes which cannot
  be relayed easily by narration in a telvision drama <a href="SS.html#Fred-Mother" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-73"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-74"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">74. Andrew Davies conflates some speech from the novel with a flourish in this three-part
  speech where Rosamond vows almost to herself
  in the Shooting script that not only will she marry someone different to her brother
  but that she will marry no one from her home
  town <a href="NO.html#not-like-Fred" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-74"></a>. George Eliot's narrator reveals Rosamond's pretensions to marry out of Middlemarch
  earlier in
  Chapter 11 <a href="NO.html#marrrying-out-of-Mm" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-74"></a>; Andrew Davies puts the words quietly but insistently into her mouth the first time
  she
  appears on screen <a href="PP.html#and-not-like" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-74"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-75"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">75. Rosamond's preference for the phrase 'the best of them' over 'the pick of them'
  is another example of how she marks herself
  out as more refined than the rest of her family. Andrew Davies utilises Eliot's small
  observations of register from the novel to establish key traits of
  Rosamond's character in this, her first appearance in the dramatisation <a href="NO.html#the-best-of-them" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-75"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-76"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">76. In interview, actress Trevyn McDowell (McGowan) reveals how she wished to bring
  a modern voice to her portrayal of Rosamond but
  also that her nature was a product of her being indulged by her parents. An element
  that is strongly reflected in the breakfast scene
  <a href="assets/I-04-T-03-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-76"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/104" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-76"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-77"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">77. The sibling sparring starts simply in Davies' script with Rosamond objecting to
  Fred calling her 'Rosie'. She insists on
  'Rosamond' - indicating she is no longer a girl. This is an innovation by Davies to
  signal the nature of their relationship. In the novel they
  initally argue in a more complex way over the use of slang terms <a href="NO.html#Rosamond-not-Rosie" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-77"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-78"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">78. For the rest of the verbal sparring between Rosamond and Fred, Davies selects
  two arguments from the novel: why does
  Fred have to be disagreeable and why he chooses a kipper for breakfast. Davies modernises
  the phraseology to bring greater pace to the
  dialogue <a href="NO.html#disagreeable-brothers" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-78"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-79"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">79. Rosamond agrees to visit Uncle Featherstone 'To please you, Mamma' in the Shooting
  script. It is not until Scene 1/23 that Fred
  understands her real reason for visiting is the off-chance of meeting Lydgate. In
  the novel her agenda is revealed by the narrator when, in
  Chapter 11, Rosamond pretends she does not mind where she rides out with Fred but
  the reader is then made privy to her

<p id="note-80"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">80. In the novel, the breakfast scene is the first time the reader meets Fred. At
  home he comes across as a confident young man of
  education, with some arrogance. In Davies' adaptation the first appearance of Fred
  is in Scene 1/17 where he is playing billiards at The Green Dragon.
  He loses the game, then is called over to the horsedealer Bambridge and explains he
  still can't repay his debt to him. A very different first insight
  into Fred than the Vincy breakfast in the novel.</p>


<p id="note-81"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">81. There is a longer commentary on Scene 1/21, here <a href="CO.html#comment-90" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-81"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-82"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">82. Fred grasps Rosamond's real reason for visiting Stone Court with her question
  about the 'new doctor' attending Featherstone. Andrew
  Davies makes this part of their light-hearted dialogue during their ride, whereas
  in the novel, Mrs Vincy asks about Lydgate over breakfast and Fred terms him a prig.
  His sister
  soaks up all the information she can about the new doctor from this conversation <a href="NO.html#Fred-first-talks-of-Lydgate" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-82"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-83"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">83. As a reminder of how young Fred is, Andrew Davies has him envy the mounts of other
  young men as he rides along with his sister. In this interview extract,
  Davies equates this kind of desire for a better horse with young men of the 1990s
  wish for an impressive car.
  This comment also foreshadows Fred's disastrous horse-buying in Episode 2.</p>


<p id="note-84"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">84. This is the first sight of Featherstone's house, Stone Court, in the adaptation,
  the location for which was the privately-owned Stragglethorpe Hall
  in Lincolnshire <a href="image.html?asset=P-30.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-84"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-85"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">85. Stone Court features prominently on the cover of the Block 2 Production schedule
  which covers the second set of country house location shoots (1 May-15 June 1993)
  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-91.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-85"></a>. The central image is of Producer, Louis Marks and in top-left corner Script editor,
  Susie Chapman is pictured as costume stand-in for Mrs
  Cadwallader.</p>


<p id="note-86"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">86. Andrew Davies' Shooting script retains Featherstone's words from Chapter 12 telling
  the 'two misses' ['missies' here] to take themselves off <a href="NO.html#two-missies" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-86"></a>.
  This leads to an episode in the novel where Mary and Roasmond go to Mary's room and
  talk, revealing their familiarity with one another from childhood <a href="NO.html#Ros-and-Mary-confer" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-86"></a>.
  This line is excised from the Post-production script and replaced with Featherstone's
  'Off with you' which is directed at the 'row of Waules' in the screen version <a href="PP.html#Off-with-you" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-86"></a>
  Mary also moves away to be with Rosamond by the piano, leaving Fred and Featherstone
  together.</p>


<p id="note-87"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">87. There is only a hint here in Davies use of the phrase 'a little bird has told
  me' of the long story that Mrs Waule has been
  telling her brother Featherstone in Chapter 12 about Fred supposedly bragging of his
  future inheritance to his debtors <a href="NO.html#Mrs-Waules-story" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-87"></a>.
  Davies' stage direction and the camera's shot of the Waules <a href="SS.html#Waules-in-black" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-87"></a> sat on the opposite side of Featherstone's parlour is left to convey something of
  Fred's comment
  to Rosamond at the start of Chapter 12 that 'they hang about my uncle like vultures'
  <a href="NO.html#Waules-as-vultures" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-87"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-88"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">88. To support the idea that Fred suspects the Waules of telling tales about his debts,
  in the screened version, shots of him glancing back at
  Jane Waule are edited into the previous speech from Featherstone and his own here.
  No mention of this is made in the novel while the stage direction to this effect comes
  in
  both the Shooting script and the Post-production script at the end of Fred's speech
  <a href="PP.html#Fred-glares-SD" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-88"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-89"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">89. Eliot's chosen idiolect for Featherstone is reflected by Davies here with his
  use of 'dockimentation' for 'documentation'. In the novel there
  are further instances of this, for example with 'speckliating fellow' and 'speckilation'
  later in Chapter 12 <a href="NO.html#speckliation" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-89"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-90"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">90. Davies uses the device of Featherstone's coughing, brought on by laughing at his
  own joke to bring Mary and Rosamond back to the group. In the novel
  a bell is rung to summon them from Mary's room <a href="NO.html#ring-for-Mary" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-90"></a> and it is this same bell that Mary hears at the end of their chat
  <a href="NO.html#second-ring-for-Mary" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-90"></a>. In effect, Eliot creates a short flashback scene here, bookended by the ring of
  the bell.</p>


<p id="note-91"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">91. In the novel, Fred has sent the books ahead to Stone Court and before Mary reappears
  with his sister, Featherstone has admonished him about this
  and asked him to send her no more <a href="NO.html#no-more-books" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-91"></a>. In the Post-production script, Davies introduces Mary's reading and admonishes Fred
  in front of her.
  She however stands up to him, the stage directions noting she treats Featherstone
  'much more like an equal than FRED and ROSAMOND do' <a href="PP.html#treats-Feather-as-equal" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-91"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-92"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">92. Note that the last two pages of Scene 1/25 are missing from the Shooting script,
  possibly removed
  by script editor Susie Conklin to send to script-writer Andrew Davies. Link here to
  the equivalent
  Post-production script for these pages <a href="PP.html#end-of-Scene-1.25" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-92"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-93"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">93. Rosamond's singing of 'Home Sweet Home' takss over from the sound of Lydgate's
  arrival at Stonecourt on horseback
  as Scene 1/26 cuts to Scene 1/27 in the parlour where Rosamond is at the piano <a href="assets/F-08.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-93"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-94"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">94. Note that the first page of Scene 1/27 is missing from the Shooting script, possibly
  removed
  by script editor Susie Conklin to send to screenwriter Andrew Davies. Link here to

<p id="note-95"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">95. Trevyn McDowell's interview offers some interesting insights as to how she and
  Anthony Page
  interpreted Rosamond and one way in which she had hoped to use her own singing voice
  in this portrayal <a href="assets/I-04-T-01.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-95"></a>
  <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/104" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-95"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-96"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">96. Davies' stage directions in Scene 1/27 refer repeatedly to looks exchanged between
  Lydgate and Rosamond.
  They hold one another's gaze or avert their eyes. This is the language of 'love at
  first sight' which Eliot refers to as
  Rosamond later reflects on her meeting with Lydgate (Ch.12) <a href="NO.html#love-at-first-sight" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-96"></a>. Unlike this scene,
  in the novel, Lydgate just misses Rosamond's song upon which he comments when they
  next meet (Ch.16) <a href="NO.html#not-heard-Ros-sing" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-96"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-97"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">97. The action slows right down here in the screened version focusing on the chemistry
  created by the
  actors playing Rosamond and Lydgate. Trevyn McDowell talks of her previous experience
  of working with Douglas Hodge and how they
  developed the Rosamond-Lydgate relationship with Anthony Page <a href="assets/I-04-T-02.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-97"></a>
  <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/104" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-97"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-98"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">98. Andrew Davies subtly adapts this moment giving it an ambivalence - does Rosamond
  genuinely mislay her riding whip
  and Lydgate merely comes to her aid? Or is it her ruse to bring him cloer to her?
  In the novel she is simply on her way to pick up
  her whip when he intervenes <a href="NO.html#the-whip-moment" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-98"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-99"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">99. There is a longer commentary on this scene, here <a href="CO.html#comment-100" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-99"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-100"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">100. Davies transposes this dialogue of this first part of Scene 1/28 from Ch. 11
  in the novel where over
  breakfast, Mrs Vincy has asked Fred about his impressions of the new Doctor Lydgate
  and Rosamond has quietly paid her full
  attention <a href="NO.html#Fred-first-talks-of-Lydgate" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-100"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-101"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">101. This line from Rosamond about 'being of good family' does not appear in the Shooting
  script but it does
  appear one of her original responses to Fred's introduction to Lydgate around the
  Vincy breakfast table in Ch. 11 of the
  novel <a href="NO.html#being-of-good-family" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-101"></a>. In the Post-production script Fred's speech is split, unlike in the Shooting script,

  so that his question about Mary's view of him starts a new speech. Rosamond's line
  also shows how she glosses over the fact that
  Tertius's richer relative does not know how to manage money.</p>


<p id="note-102"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">102. At the end of Ch. 12 in the novel, Fred does not ask what Mary said of him but
  if Mary has said Mrs Waule has
  reported anything detrimental about him to Featherstone. He is trying to find out
  where Featherstone has gained his information about
  Fred's behaviour. Mrs Waule is the one who has said Fred is 'unsteady' but Davies
  adapts it to be Mary who says this. This minute change
  makes it personal and reinforces Mary's reported words from the novel that she would
  refuse Fred if he were to propose <a href="NO.html#choice-of-the-word-unsteady" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-102"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-103"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">103. The tone Rosamond's of words here do not match the more friendly nature of the
  conversation in the novel between her and Mary at
  Stone Court. Davies generally portrays Rosamond as less kind to Mary. For example
  in Chapter 12, Rosamond courteously asks Mary if she can
  repeat to Fred or to her mother what Mary has said about a marriage proposal <a href="NO.html#Ros-asks-nicely" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-103"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-104"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">104. The end of Scene 1/28 corresponds with the end of Book 1 (Ch. 12) of the novel
  <a href="NO.html#end-of-book-1" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-104"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-105"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">105. Andrew Davies gives a more definite purpose to Dorothea's walk with Monk in Chapter
  3 by introducing the visit to the
  ailing Mr Barnacle. In the novel this walk is to allow her to think about the possibility
  of a proposal from Casaubon and how this would open
  up greater opportunity to do good <a href="NO.html#walk-with-Monk" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-105"></a>. The only real hint of this purpose comes in the opening stage direction
  about her condering life as the 'wife of a genius' which persists into the Post-production
  script <a href="PP.html#wife-of-genius" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-105"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-106"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">106. The dialogue softens between Shooting script and the Post-production script with
  Dorothea shifting from a lady bountiful figure
  to a person well-known to her tenants, addressing the children familiarly by name
  <a href="PP.html#Barnacle-children" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-106"></a>. This sense
  in the Post-production script of Dorothea's class superority being downplayed is also
  reflected in the cut to the last two lines lines of her speech here, in
  the Shooting script <a href="SS.html#honoured" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-106"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-107"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">107. Eliot's exploration of Dorothea's intense 'religious disposition' during her
  walk with Monk <a href="NO.html#intense-religiosity" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-107"></a>
  is reflected in Davies' stage direction for her to fall on her knees beside the sick
  tenant's bed. This action disappears from the Post-production
  script <a href="PP.html#Dor-knees" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-107"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-108"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">108. Dorothea's speech reveals the other main dramatic reason for the inclusion of
  her visit to the Barnacles: to remind the audience
  that Mr Brooke, for all his higher thoughts of reform, is not a considerate or very
  dutiful landlord. Neither Dorothea nor Mrs Barnacle hold out much hope of
  the cottage roof being repaired. Dorothea's rather unrealistic for this historical
  period promise to send the doctor to Mr Barnacle is removed between the Shooting script

  and the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#promise-of-doctor" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-108"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-109"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">109. Davies here condenses two speeches from this conversation from the novel and
  a recollection of Dorothea's from later in Chapter 3
  when she recalls Chettam does not instead give the pet dog to Celia as she anticipated
  he would. She thinks to herself that at least it will not be
  there at Tipton for her to tread on <a href="NO.html#tread-on-puppy" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-109"></a>. Her reaction to his gift is symptomatic of her blindness to Chettam's
  wish to court her.</p>


<p id="note-110"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">110. This comment from Chettam is in reaction to Dorothea's opinion on toy breeds
  of dog in the novel <a href="NO.html#Chettams-slight-envy" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-110"></a>
  but in the Post-production script it is used instead to express Chettams's slight
  envy of her sureness of opinion on more significant matters of social
  injustice <a href="PP.html#Chettams-envy" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-110"></a>. Whereas in the Shooting script his line is the blander 'I'm... very much of your
  opinion!'</p>


<p id="note-111"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">111. In the novel, the conversation in Scene 1/33 largely takes place between Celia
  and Dorothea in their carriage as they return from viewing
  of Sir James's new cottage sites in Chapter 4. There has been far more liasion between
  Dorothea and Sir James over the cottage plans in Chapter 3 than is included
  in the adaptation. The enclosed and intimate location of the carriage gives Celia
  the opportunity to tell Dorothea a few home truths about Sir James' intentions
  towards her <a href="NO.html#Celia-hometruths" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-111"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-112"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">112. The inclusion of Brooke in this scene is largely to open up the chance of a further
  invitation to Tipton Grange for Casaubon and to show
  Celia that Dorothea favours this. '(Celia sighs)' at the thought of this invitaton
  in the Shooting script but by the Post-production script her line 'Oh no!'
  has been added to make her feeling clearer <a href="PP.html#Celias-oh-no" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-112"></a>. In respsonse, Dorothea looks up from her open book at the breakfast table to assure

  Brooke he should invite Casaubon 'as often as he is willing to come.' The open book
  is a reference to Chapter 3 and her new habit of reading 'learned books' whenever

  possible so as appear less ignorant in conversation with Casaubon <a href="NO.html#open-book" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-112"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-113"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">113. In the Shooting script Davies skilfully uses concision with the original longer
  conversation in Chapter 4 for dramatic effect. He removes
  Celia's softer approach to the topic of Sir James - where she tells her sister of
  rumours circulating among the servants of Dorothea's forthcoming match with Sir
  James before stating plainly that he is 'very much in love' with her, so dispelling
  Dorothea's ideas that he thinks only of her as a 'future  sister'
  <a href="NO.html#rumours-match" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-113"></a>. Instead, Celia's statement of Chettam's love for Dorothea comes much sooner in the
  script and makes a stronger impact both on Dorothea and the audience.</p>


<p id="note-114"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">114. The fact that Dorothea walks out shows a strength of feeling that she is not
  able to convey in the novel because she has to remain in
  the carriage at close quarters with Celia until they reach Tipton. The physical effect
  of this shock on her is made clear in Chapter 4 and the reason Eliot offers
  for this is not that Dorothea worries she has led Sir James on but that her altruistic
  plans are now in shreds because of a misconstruction of 'society' on their friendship

  <a href="NO.html#purblind-society" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-114"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-115"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">115. This scene where Dorothea greets her uncle and follows him up the steps to the
  main entrance to Tipton Grange is one of the many uses made of the
  front of Culverthorpe Hall in the dramatisation <a href="image.html?asset=P-219.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-115"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-116"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">116. In Chapter 4 of the novel it is Brooke who greets Dorothea and Celia at Tipton
  when they return from Freshitt. He is back from a trip to petition
  'for the pardon of some criminal'<a href="NO.html#petition-assizes" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-116"></a>. Although the scene where the sisters argue and this one are adjacent in the Shooting
  script
  they are separated by four scenes in the Vincy and Lydgate plots in the Post-production
  script <a href="PP.html#separated-courtship-scenes" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-116"></a>. This gives a sense of some
  days passing between Celia's revelation to Dorothea and this moment.</p>


<p id="note-117"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">117. The result of the Assizes case is brought forward by Davies, with Brooke confirming
  to Dorothea that Bunch the sheep-stealer will hang.
  In Chapter 4, how the criminal fared is not mentioned until they are settled in front
  of the fire and it acts as a prelude to Brooke broaching Casaubon's
  wish to propose to Dorothea <a href="NO.html#Bunch-hanging" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-117"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-118"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">118. Dorothea and Brooke are in the sitting room at Tipton Grange rather than the
  library as is stated in the opening stage directions. This is an interesting
  setting in which to consider Production designer, Gerry Scott's interview comments
  on her contrasting choices of decor for the older families' country houses and the
  newer monied
  families' Middlemarch houses <a href="image.html?asset=PM-90.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-118"></a> <a href="assets/PM-90-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-118"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-118"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-119"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">119. The Shooting script starts with Scene 1/38 where at Tipton Dorothea, seated
  by the fire, hears Casaubon's voice as she reads his letter of proposal. The order
  of Scenes 1/38 and 1/39
  is reversed in the Post-production script so that the reading of the letter starts
  with Casaubon
  in his library and then switches to Dorothea reading by the fire <a href="PP.html#scene-reorder-38-and-39" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-119"></a>,
  as can be seen in the film version <a href="assets/F-04.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-119"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-120"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">120. Casaubon's letter of proposal opens Chapter 5 in the novel, where the epigraph
  also has a proleptic quality <a href="NO.html#Casaubons-letter-of-proposal" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-120"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-121"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">121. Andrew Davies omits Dorothea's letter in reply to Casaubon's proposal.
  Dorothea's response in Chapter 5 of the novel is short but she copies it out three
  times before she is
  happy with it <a href="NO.html#Dorothea-reply-to-proposal" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-121"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-122"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">122. The detail of Causaubon's noisy soup eating is retained by Davies from the novel
  in both the
  Shooting script and the Post-production script, as an indication of how unattractive
  he is in social and conventional terms
  to a  young woman of marriageable age. Dorothea has clearly not even noticed this
  about her suitor. Davies, however, omits Celia's
  much deeper and growing suspicions of her older sister's attraction to the older man
  which Eliot reveals in the novel as Celia
  recalls Dorothea's 'admiration' for the 'ugly and learned' teacher, 'Monsieur Liret
  at Lausanne' <a href="NO.html#Monsieur-Liret" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-122"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-123"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">123. The build-up to Dorothea's revelation that she has accepted Casaubon's proposal
  is not reflected in
  Davies' adaptation with the effect that Celia's startled look here makes her look
  unprepared for Dorothea's angry reaction.
  In the novel, at this point, Celia is instead in trepidation that Dorothea is about
  to make the engagement known to her.<a href="NO.html#Celias-javelin" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-123"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-124"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">124. There is a longer commentary on Scenes 1/37-40, here <a href="CO.html#comment-105" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-124"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-125"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">125. Scenes 1/42-1/45 in the Shooting script which depict the first meeting between
  Dorothea and Casaubon after
  the proposal do not appear at all in the Post-production script. Instead the action
  leaps straight to Freshitt and Chettam's reaction to the news
  of their engagement in Scenes 1/46 and 1/47.<a href="PP.html#Chettams-reaction-at-Freshitt" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-125"></a>. These scenes may have been
  shot but later edited out due to timing considerations or a directorial decision may
  have been taken to truncate the Dorothea-Casaubon courtship
  still further for the television audience.</p>


<p id="note-126"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">126. In this stage direction Davies overlays Casaubon's arrival with Gothic conventions
  - the dark carriage,
  the coachman in black, the intimidating trot of the horses and Casaubon seated in
  the interior in his 'rather frightening black hat'.
  Celia, acting as self-appointed look-out, witnesses this forbidding arrival.</p>


<p id="note-127"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">127. Scenes 1/42-1/44 which announce Casaubon's arrival and then bring the couple
  together do not figure in
  Chapter 5 of the novel <a href="NO.html#no-big-entrance" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-127"></a>. Visually, they are quite flamboyant, with Dorothea viewing her suitor from
  the top of the stairs and then running down to greet him. They match the verbal flamboyance
  of Scene 1/45.</p>


<p id="note-128"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">128. Davies includes verbatim, some of the highly archaic phrases from Casaubon's
  wooing dialogue with
  Dorothea <a href="NO.html#archaic-wooing" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-128"></a>. Had this survived, the 1990s television audience may have found it hard to believe
  that the heroine could continue with the engagement, without the presence of Eliot's
  narratorial comment that while Casaubon's intention
  was 'honest' his speeech 'at the end was as sincere as... the cawing of an amorous
  rook'<a href="NO.html#amorous-rook" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-128"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-129"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">129. Davies effects a narrative reversal in Scenes 1/46-1/47 by having Chettam deliver
  the news of Dorothea's
  engagement to his mother and Mrs Cadwallader. In Chapter 7 of the novel it is she
  who discovers the news from Celia and drives directly to
  Freshitt to tell Chettam <a href="NO.html#Mrs-C-heads-to-Freshitt" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-129"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-130"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">130. Note that the whole of Scene 1/47 is missing from the Shooting script, possibly
  removed
  by script editor Susie Conklin to send to script-writer Andrew Davies. Link here to

<p id="note-131"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">131. The scene opens in media res with Chettam bemoaning the engagement news. Mrs
  Cadwallader and
  his mother do not seem as surprised by it as he does and placate him. Davies takes
  the two-hander 'one foot in the grave' joke straight from
  the conversation between Mrs Cadwallader and Sir James in Chapter 7<a href="NO.html#one-foot-in-the-grave" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-131"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-132"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">132. Mrs Cadwallader's acerbic tone also reverberates from the novel when she likens
  Casaubon's 'great soul'
  to 'a great bladder for dried peas to rattle in'<a href="NO.html#dried-peas" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-132"></a>. Davies deftly manages to refer back to the
  earlier conversation in Chapter 7 where Celia tells Mrs Cadwallader that Dorothea
  has chosen Casaubon for his 'great soul'
  <a href="NO.html#great-soul" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-132"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-133"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">133. Davies takes a speech, which Eliot claims Mrs Cadwallader makes 'first to herself
  and afterwards to her husband' in Chapter 6
  <a href="NO.html#sane-sensible" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-133"></a>, and has her deliver it directly to Chettam in Scene 1/47.</p>

  6 here <a href="assets/PF-06.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-134"></a>.
  The narrator steps alongside Mrs Cadawallader to explore her preoccupations and uses
  her a vehicle for comedy.</p>


<p id="note-135"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">135. The seed of the match between Chettam and Celia is planted by the two women.
  Davies uses Mrs Cadwallader's
  comment from the novel that Celia already admires him as much as 'a man expects to
  be admired' only omitting Eliot's narrator's 'almost'
  before 'as much as'<a href="NO.html#admires-almost" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-135"></a>. Lady Chettam follows up with comments reinforcing how conventional Celia is -
  her docility, her love of geraniums</p>


<p id="note-136"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">136. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  6 here <a href="assets/PF-07.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-136"></a>.
  The narrator steps back from the action, as omniscient narrator considering all 'men
  and women', but still counts themselves among 'We mortals'.
  In doing so, the narrator comments that although Sir James may be proud in his actions
  he is hiding his 'own hurts' so as 'not to hurt others'.
  This moment when Chettam decides he will ride to visit the Brooke sisters afterall
  is not one that Davies chose to adapt.</p>


<p id="note-137"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">137. Davies' closing stage direction implies that Chettam is already beginning to
  see how pragmatic a marriage to
  Celia would be. This hints at his actions at the end of Chapter 7: after Mrs Cadwallader
  leaves, he first takes a ride away from Tipton but
  then turns back to pay a visit there, to Celia <a href="NO.html#direction-change" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-137"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-138"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">138. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  7 here <a href="assets/PF-08.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-138"></a>. The narrator
  effects a brief time shift here to look ahead to when Brooke will criticise bishops'
  incomes as part of an election speech whereas here he is hoping that a
  bishop's title will come Casaubon's way. By using prolepsis, Eliot suggests how time
  can make a hypocrite of most people.'</p>


<p id="note-139"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">139. The grim exterior of the old infirmary and the scene of the poor man in a fever
  that follows is a stark reminder
  after the previous scene at Freshitt Hall in the Shooting script and at Tipton Grange
  in the Post-production script of the contrast between
  the conditions of the landed classes and the working people of Middlemarch <a href="PP.html#old-infirm" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-139"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-140"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">140. The characters named 'Patient' and 'Wife' in the Shooting script become the named
  individuals, Mr and Mrs Tegg,
  in the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#shoemakers" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-140"></a>. In this invented scene, Davies personalises these minor characters using the
  family name of the shoemakers in Middlemarch mentioned in Chapter 16 of the novel
  <a href="NO.html#shoemaker-Teggs" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-140"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-141"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">141. Mr Tegg's lines become much shorter between the Shooting script, and the Post-production
  speech. This speech in particular
  also loses much of it specificity: the fact that he works in Vincy's ribbon factory
  is cut between the two scripts and the fact that 'the shuttle's broke'
  <a href="PP.html#shuttle" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-141"></a> is lost between the Post-production script and the onscreen version. The effect of
  this and other changes, such as the
  Nurse character being removed and the 'iced-water' treatment <a href="SS.html#iced-water" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-141"></a> becoming 'tepid sponging'<a href="PP.html#tepid" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-141"></a>,
  mean the focus moves much faster and more intensively to Lydgate's new medical ideas
  and bedside manner.</p>


<p id="note-142"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">142. Mrs Tegg's fear of the illness being cholera reminds the viewer that fear of
  this disease reaching the town pervades
  Middlemarch. Lydgate's response is calm and measured. As doctor who has worked beyond
  the provinces, he has experience of the disease and is sure this is not
  cholera. The instructions on how to protect the Tegg children at home disappear between
  the Shooting and Post-production scripts <a href="PP.html#not-cholera" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-142"></a>.
  Douglas Hodge as Lydgate instils confidence in Mrs Tegg with his manner as much as
  his advice.</p>


<p id="note-143"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">143. From the Shooting script to the Post-production script, Vincy's opening speech
  reminding the viewer why Fred
  needs the letter, is omitted. In the Post-production script Scene 1/50 appears earlier
  in Episode 1 and so can open <em>in media
    res</em> <a href="PP.html#Vincy-Bulstrode-in-media-res" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-143"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-144"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">144. Davies often chooses to omit a specific but retain a general point in dialogue
  and this can sometimes
  result in a less nuanced plot or characer depiction. Here Vincy merely points out
  that Bulstrode is as fond of a profitable deal
  as any other man. In the novel, Eliot goes further, hinting that Bulstrode's dealings
  with Plymdale make him party to the use of
  inferior dyes. Vincy hints that he could make this public if Bulstrode does not support
  Fred with the letter to Featherstone. This
  detail also reveals the fine margins by which textile manufacturers in Middlemarch
  are operating <a href="NO.html#blue-green-dyes" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-144"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-145"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">145. Featherstone reads much more of Bulstrode's letter to Fred in Chapter 14 of the
  novel <a href="NO.html#distinctly-affirm" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-145"></a>.
  This is indicative of Davies' powerful condensation of this whole chapter into three
  short scenes in his adaptation: Scene 1/51 and Scenes 153a and b.
  In the Shooting script he also borrows Featherstone's words from Chapter 12 that foresee
  Bulstrode's eventual fall 'any day when the Devil leaves off
  backing him'<a href="NO.html#Devil-leaves-off" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-145"></a>. This part of Featherstone's speech is subsequently cut from the Post-production
  script perhaps
  as it represented too much of a spoiler for the Bulstrode plot <a href="PP.html#Bulstrode-spoiler" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-145"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-146"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">146. The action relating to the handing over of Fred's 'present' from Featherstone
  shrinks from Fred fetching the money-tin in the Shooting
  script to Featherstone producing it from under the bedclothes in the Post-production
  script. This allows the camera to focus on Fred's keen anticpation
  of the tin being opened <a href="PP.html#money-tin-bedclothes" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-146"></a>. In the novel the clearly upset, red-eyed, Mary is called upstairs to fetch the money-tin,

  alerting the reader to how she is bullied by Featherstone when no visitors are around
  <a href="NO.html#redeyed-Mary" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-146"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-147"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">147. The Post-production script ends with Featherstone's emphatic 'I should think
  you are' <a href="PP.html#emphatic_featherstone" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-147"></a>
  rather than the limp stock expresson of gratitude from Fred in the Shooting script.
  Featherstone's parting line signals his continuing power over Fred which
  is far more evident in the novel where he insists Fred should count out the banknotes
  and consider their value while he relishes being able to influence the young man
  <a href="NO.html#smug-featherstone" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-147"></a>. </p>


<p id="note-148"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">148. Mary's location and chore - hanging washing up outside - evolves into folding
  washing on the landing outside Featherstone's room in the
  Post-production script Scene 1/53a <a href="PP.html#folding-washing" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-148"></a>. This was probably due to the spaces available for shooting at Stragglethorpe Hall
  (used for Stone Court
  in the dramatisation)<a href="image.html?asset=P-30.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-148"></a>. Both locations contrast with Mary's more comfortable setting in Chapter 14 of the
  novel where she sits, reading by the fire, as Fred comes
  downstairs <a href="NO.html#sewing-by-fire" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-148"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-149"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">149. In Eliot's dialogue between Mary and Fred in Chapter 14 there is no discussion
  at all of Featherstone's payment to Fred. It is taken
  as read, as Mary was present when the money-tin was opened and so knows of it. Davies
  chooses to introduce the topic as it allows him to seed the subplot of the Caleb Garth's

  involvement in underwriting Fred's debt in the line 'a very good friend - the best
  fellow I know has signed a bill'. And this element survives into the Post-prodcuction
  script
  <a href="PP.html#money-mention" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-149"></a>. In the novel, Fred instead raises Mary's mood with his jealousy of John Waule's
  visit to her leading to some lighter banter between them
  <a href="NO.html#Marys-spirits" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-149"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-150"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">150. Mary's comment 'My father says an idle man ought not to exist, much less be married'
  is verbatim from the novel but it quickly turns to levity here
  when Fred asks over-dramatically 'what am I to do? Blow my brains out?'. This humour
  can only be hinted at in the brief lines that pass between Mary and Fred but is far

  more pronounced, conveying their underlying love for one another in the novel <a href="NO.html#Marys-humour" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-150"></a>. In the Shooting script Davies has Mary succinctly combine
  gentle teasing with sound advice about completing his exam in her response. In the
  Post-production script her line is delivered once she has moved downstairs with Fred
  in pursuit
  as they transition into Scene 153b <a href="PP.html#pass-exam" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-150"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-151"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">151. Davies ends the debate between Fred and Mary in a more conciliatory way in the
  Shooting script than in the Post-production script which takes Mary's
  admonishment as her parting shot. She delivers this and heads rapidly back upstairs
  with the folded washing, leaving Fred looking miserable in the hallway <a href="PP.html#parting-shot" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-151"></a>.
  In the Shooting script, she turns back to him and acknowledges the depth of her affection
  for him but implies he has just gone to far. This emulates the closing mood of Chapter
  14 where
  Fred departs still with hope of winning Mary <a href="NO.html#Freds-hope" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-151"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-152"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">152. Many of the details from the description of Lowick in the novel are retained
  by Davies in this the viewer's first encounter with Casaubon's estate. It is all 'yew
  trees'
  and 'greenish façade' summoning images of death and stagnation. There is no brighter
  side to the house with a lime tree avenue as there is in the novel <a href="NO.html#lime-tree-walk" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-152"></a>.
  A pale Casaubon stands outside waiting for the Tipton party to arrive <a href="NO.html#no-bloom-Casaubon" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-152"></a> but in the script he greets them at the door, rather warmly
  <a href="PP.html#warm-greeting" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-152"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-153"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">153. The rear courtyard and entrance to Brympton d'Evercy in Somerset corresponded
  closely with the description of Lowick Manor in both the novel and Davies'
  stage directions. The porchway pictured here is where Casaubon welcomes his betrothed
  and her family in Scene 1/56 <a href="image.html?asset=P-213.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-153"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-154"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">154. This opening stage direction to Scene  1/57 which remains the same in both scripts
  <a href="PP.html#Lowick-impressions" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-154"></a> reflects a long description in Chapter 9
  of the novel of Dorothea's initial idealistic impressions of Lowick where she imagines
  spending her married life <a href="NO.html#starry-eyed-Dor" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-154"></a>. Unlike Celia, she can only see good
  in the dimly-lit rooms and laden bookcases<a href="NO.html#frosty-dump" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-154"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-155"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">155. Locating the betrothed couple alone in Casaubon's library, Davies sets up this
  scene as potentially romantic. In fact, the only things to receive caresses are the

  notebooks. In his stage directions, Davies implies that Dorothea's feelings are spiritual
  - those of the 'novitiate'. The irony of staging a positively-charged library scene,
  which
  from here on becomes a location of constant conflict between Dorothea and Casaubon,
  will only be appreciated by the viewer in later episodes. The sunlight that Casaubon
  sheds on his books by
  opening the drapes in the Shooting script is omitted from the Post-production script
  stage directions, either for lighting design or symbolic reasons <a href="PP.html#Cas-drapes" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-155"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-156"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">156. The dialogue between Dorothea and Casaubon about his work and her suggestion
  that she might start learning Latin and Greek to help him, does not happen on her
  first
  visit to Lowick in the novel. Dorothea merely admires 'the dark book-shelves in the
  long library' in Chapter 9 <a href="NO.html#starry-eyed-Dor" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-156"></a>. Davies extracts this conversation,
  including the reference to Milton's daughters from Chapter 7 where it takes place
  during one of Casaubon's courtship visits to Tipton Grange <a href="NO.html#Miltons-daughters" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-156"></a>. This
  scene might hint to the viewer that there may yet be potential in this working relationship.</p>


<p id="note-157"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">157. Note that the whole of Scene 1/59 is missing from the Shooting script, possibly
  removed
  by script editor Susie Conklin to send to screenwriter Andrew Davies. Link here to
  the equivalent
  Post-production script for this scene <a href="PP.html#whole-of-Scene-1.59" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-157"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-158"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">158. Davies has his vociferous Brooke, in the person of Robert Hardy, comment loudly
  on revamping the decor at Lowick not only in Scene 1/59 but also in Scene 1/60.
  This only occurs once in the novel where Dorothea gently closes him down on this topic
  and makes reassuring noises with 'No uncle... Pray do not speak of altering anything'

  <a href="NO.html#duck-egg-blue" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-158"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-159"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">159. Davies' dialogue in Scene 1/60 follows the conversation in Chapter 9 about the
  portraits of Casaubon's mother and her prettier sister very closely <a href="NO.html#prettier-sister" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-159"></a>.
  However, in the novel it is Dorothea, sensing the topic is awkward for Casaubon, who
  suggests they walk in the garden. By contrast, in the Post-production script the idea
  comes from Casaubon
  <a href="PP.html#Casaubons-suggestion" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-159"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-160"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">160. There is no stage direction in the Shooting script requiring the final shot in
  this scene to be of Dorothea continuing to study the miniature of Aunt Julia. But
  this
  is how the scene ends on screen, though not recorded in the Post-production script
  <a href="PP.html#no-final-look" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-160"></a>. The portrait prop is purposely drawn to reflect the features of Rufus
  Sewell (Ladislaw), whom Dorothea meets in the next scene. This provides an effective
  visual link to the novel where Eliot describes how Dorothea immediately identifies
  the same features in
  Ladislaw as she saw in the miniature of his grandmother <a href="NO.html#julias-features" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-160"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-161"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">161. Ladislaw's hat - a motif that carries associations of his Polish political emigre
  status - is introduced by Eliot in Chapter 9 to reveal his handsome face when he looks
  up
  from under its brim <a href="NO.html#hatless-Ladislaw" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-161"></a>. Davies who make much use of the hat for stage business in his later directions,
  chooses to present a hatless Ladislaw in this first encounter with Dorothea, perhaps

  because for a late twentieth-century audience a man sketching in a formal hat in a
  garden setting might seem out of place.</p>


<p id="note-162"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">162. Davies abbreviates the walk around the gardens at Lowick substantially from the
  novel. There Celia glimpses Ladislaw before they are introduced to Mr Tucker the curate

  at Lowick who assures Dorothea that the tenants and cottages on Casaubon's estate
  are all well cared for. This scuppers her hopes of doing good works and improvments
  once she is
  married <a href="NO.html#Mr-Tucker" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-162"></a>. Brooke then asks who 'that youngster' is in the garden which forms the entry point
  for Scene 1/61<a href="NO.html#that-youngster" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-162"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-163"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">163. Davies' introduction of Dorothea's love interest is low-key in comparison even
  with the novel, where her comment about art is taken the wrong way by Ladislaw a later

  chapter reveals <a href="NO.html#low-key-meeting" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-163"></a>. On screen the performances of Sewell and Aubrey do not seem to play up to the 'keen
  interest' in Dorothea that the Shooting script stage
  directions request from Ladislaw and his 'ironic' smile at Brooke's invitation to
  Tipton is not in evidence.</p>


<p id="note-164"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">164. Andrew Davies uses stage direction to hint at Ladislaw's sense of humour. Eliot
  expands on his ability to laugh at life in the novel
  ('Ladislaw thinks she must be barmy')<a href="NO.html#Ladislaw-sense-of-humour" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-164"></a>. At such moments Davies' candour about characters' inner life, while doubtless useful
  for actors and director, is almost always underplayed
  in performance.</p>


<p id="note-165"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">165. The dialogue in the Shooting script represents a highly pared-down version of
  the conversation in the novel between Dorothea, Casaubon and Brooke that follows the

  meeting with Ladislaw in Chapter 9 <a href="NO.html#support-and-patience" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-165"></a>. This effect is exacerbated in the Post-production script where Dorothea's speech
  is cut praising Casaubon's patience
  and support of his cousin while the young man decides on his future direction. Celia's
  stage direction, however, in response to this speech, remains redundantly in the later
  script
  <a href="PP.html#Celia-redundant" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-165"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-166"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">166. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  10 here <a href="assets/PF-09.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-166"></a>. On page 123, The narrator steps beside Will Ladislaw to
  lay open his reasoning behind his travels - a part of his 'openness to receptivity'
  of 'Genius' - and his rather hedonistic attitudes. By page 124, the narrator has stepped
  back to her omniscient
  position with 'Let him start for the Continent then, without our pronouncing on his
  future' and switches her focus to Casaubon, delving into his thoughts. The conclusion
  is that, like Will, he cannot
  help being the centre of his own world. The news of Will's departure is not represented
  in the adaptation but, sequentially, follows his introduction to Dorothea at Lowick
  and Casaubon's agreement to support
  Will in Italy for a year.<a href="SS.html#Lads-departure" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-166"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-167"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">167. Note that the first page of Scene 1/64 is missing from the Shooting script, possibly
  removed
  by script editor Susie Conklin to send to script-writer Andrew Davies. Link here to
  the equivalent Post-production script
  first page of this this scene <a href="PP.html#page-1-of-Scene-1.64" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-167"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-168"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">168. It is probable that the first page of the Shooting script was very similar in
  content to
  the to first page of the Post-production script because the second pages in each have
  same page break <a href="PP.html#page-1-pagebreak-of-Scene-1.64" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-168"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-169"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">169. The establishing Scene 1/63, changes from an evening to a daylight setting between
  the Post-production
  script and the screen version. Scene 1/64 reflects the mixing of different classes
  at Tipton Grange for
  Dorothea and Casaubon's engagement party in this clip.<a href="assets/F-05.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-169"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-170"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">170. The screen version of this scene takes place in a reception room where drinks
  are being served before the engagement dinner
  rather than as the guests enter the dining room, as in the Post-production script<a href="PP.html#guests-dining-room" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-170"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-171"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">171. Mrs Cadwallader takes on the role of commentator on those present at the engagement
  party. Davies has her comment in a
  similar way to Eliot's ironic narrator in Chapter 10, who expresses that it is unusual
  in pre-Reform times to have townsfolk and country landowners
  mixing socially <a href="NO.html#Mrs-Cad-as-narrator-1" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-171"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-172"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">172. It is at the engagement party in Chapter 10 of the novel that the reader is first
  introduced to Lydgate, towards the
  end of Book 1 "Miss Brooke". And there it is Lady Chettam who asks Mrs Cadwallader
  about him <a href="NO.html#Lydgate_first_appears_in_novel" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-172"></a>.
  In contrast, Andrew Davies opens Episode 1 with Lydgate's arrival in Middlemarch.</p>


<p id="note-173"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">173. The dialogue in Shooting script Scene 1/64 derives from the more private post-dinner
  conversations of the
  men and the women in Chapter 10. There is no pre-dinner scene in the novel. Here the
  middle-aged bachelor, Chichely, talks of Dorothea
  as a fine woman, but of his preference for a woman like Rosamond with men not in mixed
  company. There are no women in the room when
  he makes similar comments in the novel <a href="NO.html#Chichely-on-marriageable-women" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-173"></a>. This dialogue does not appear in the
  shorter Post-production script version of the scene.</p>


<p id="note-174"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">174. There is a longer commentary on this scene, here <a href="CO.html#comment-110" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-174"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-175"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">175. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  10 here <a href="assets/PF-10.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-175"></a>. On page 131, the narrator
  comments, from Mrs Cadwallader's perspective, on Brooke's choice of guests from different
  social rankings at Dorothea and Casaubon's engagement reception at Tipton Grange.

  His reasoning behind this is revealed by Mrs Cadwallader in Scene 1/64 of the Shooting
  script <a href="SS.html#toadying" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-175"></a>. In the second extract on page 133, the
  narrator reveals that even Brooke's invitations would not have extended as far as
  'Miss Vincy', a mere daughter of a manufacturer.</p>


<p id="note-176"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">176. Scene 1/65 is of Andrew Davies' invention. There is no specific source for it
  in the novel. It enables
  Davies to introduce Brooke's political aspirations and ideas on reform, earlier than
  they are introduced in the novel. His reformist ambitions
  are discussed by his political adversaries in Chapter 37 <a href="NO.html#political-enemies" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-176"></a> and by his peers and friends in Chapter 38
  <a href="NO.html#political-friends" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-176"></a>, long after Dorothea and Casaubon's are married.</p>


<p id="note-177"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">177. Brooke's speech in the Shooting script is a few lines longer than that in the
  Post-production script but it is honed to emphasise
  several key ideas for viewers of the dramatisation. The biblical reference to David
  and Jonathan going forth in friendship is cut, for example and replaced with
  the phrases 'if you will, and so forth' often used in Brooke's idiolect when is he
  nervous. And he is nervous as he moves from talking about 'progress' in life, as represented

  by the betrothal of Casaubon and Dorothea, to the context of political reform. The
  words 'progress' or 'progressive' are used throughout this short speech but reform
  - the more
  loaded political term - is only introduced in the last couple of sentence. Brooke
  gently prepares his audience for his allegiance to 'reform' whereas in the Shooting
  script he
  presents it earlier - standing alone with a capital R <a href="PP.html#reform-capital-R" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-177"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-178"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">178. Perhaps to allay the fears of men like Chettam and Chichely in the dining room,
  Brooke repeats his intention always to proceed with reform 'in
  moderation' twice in his Shooting script speech. This element of his argument is reserved
  just for the end of the Post-production script, where it gains more emphasis and
  gives a sense of Brooke playing to the different views of his guests <a href="PP.html#moderation-temperance" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-178"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-179"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">179. Davies includes the words 'and women' when Brooke welcomes the 'progressive men'
  to his table, a reference not only to his niece, Dorothea and Mrs Cadwallader
  but also to the adaptation's 1990's television audience. Certainly in the list of
  men he does welcome in person, Brooke allies himself with the reformers of different
  kinds in Middlemarch and
  proves Mrs Cadwallader's claim true that Brooke means to 'treat' the Middlemarchers
  and in her more prejudicial terms is 'toadying to the hoi polloi'
  <a href="PP.html#toadying-to-hoi-polloi" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-179"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-180"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">180. This opening stage direction reflects the main purpose of this short scene where
  Brooke effectively hands Dorothea over to
  Casaubon's care. It is significant that Brooke and Celia remain on the steps of Tipton
  Grange while Dorothea sees her future husband to his carriage.
  And it is significant that the conversation in which Dorothea is first wounded by
  Casaubon takes place 'not in earshot' of her family. Davies has also
  chosen to place this conversation after the engagement dinner, whereas it happens
  just before Dorothea and Casaubon dress for dinner in Chaper 10
  of the novel <a href="NO.html#more-at-liberty" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-180"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-181"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">181. Without a direct depiction of the marriage either in the novel or in the adaptation,
  Davies effectively invents a wedding speech for Brooke
  here. In expressing his affection for his nieces he gives Casaubon an unwitting example
  of how he should emulate such affection towards Dorothea.
  His second speech in the Shooting script actually notes 'now you shall have that happy
  task, Casaubon' though this is cut from the Post-production script.
  Nonetheless, the following stage direction inplies that this rattles Casaubon bringing
  'a trace of anxiety' into his eyes as he's largely only considered Dorothea
  bringing affection to him <a href="PP.html#that-happy-task" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-181"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-182"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">182. Celia is keener to see Casaubon on his way in the Shooting script. Her second
  speech 'This is a chilly wind.' suggests she is cold and he should not
  be detaining them on the doorstep. Only her slightly acerbic first speech remains
  in the Post-production script, perhaps the results of economy in the editing suite
  or a
  directorial means of toning down Celia's irritation at Casaubon <a href="PP.html#chilly-wind" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-182"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-183"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">183. Davies makes only a few minor changes to the dialogue that passes between Dorothea
  and Casaubon in Chapter 10 about a lady 'companion' for
  Dorothea on their honeymoon to Rome. Dorothea's reactions are perhaps more varied
  in Eliot's rendition. Casaubon's words 'grated on Dorothea' and she 'coloured from

  annoyance' as well as feeling 'hurt'. In Davies' stage directions she is 'very hurt'
  and then 'flooded by tenderness' as she realises her betrothed is scared that he has

  upset her. In the novel Casaubon remains impervious 'not in the least noticing that
  she was hurt' <a href="NO.html#grated-on" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-183"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-184"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">184. Lydgate's second visit to Bulstrode's bank could be seen as a rerun of Scene
  1/15 but Davies uses this invented scene to show that
  the stakes have increased for Lydgate since his last visit <a href="PP.html#rerun-1.15" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-184"></a>. Bulstrode is about to put further pressure on him to vote for Tyke in the chaplaincy
  election. The choice for Lydgate
  is accented in the Post-production script by the juxtaposition of this scene with
  the hospital scenes (1/48-49) that immediately precede it, where Lydgate tends to
  the feverish
  Mr Tegg and reassures his wife that Middlemarch will soon have a new fever hospital
  <a href="PP.html#Tegg-new-hospital" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-184"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-185"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">185. The frustration in Lydgate's curt question is clearly due to him being summoned
  from potentially life-saving work to discuss an issue of local politics. A few seconds
  later in this
  scene he maintains 'I'm a medical man. I have no opinion about these things' and the
  stage directions record that he is 'annoyed at being called away from his work'. But
  this scene represents the first in a short sequence
  in the build-up to the vote, and marks the start of the turmoil that afflicts Lydgate
  in the novel as he comes to realise the strength of Bulstrode's power in the town
  and struggles to decide between Farebrother and
  Tyke.<a href="NO.html#extent-of-Bs-power" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-185"></a></p>


<p id="note-186"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">186. Davies' propensity to relay Bulstrode's power in only few words of dialogue is
  strengthened here by Peter Jeffrey's low-key but sinister delivery of these lines.
  He streses ''earnestly advise' and
  'great deal' leaving Hodge's Lydgate in no doubt as to the potential effects of his
  decision.</p>


<p id="note-187"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">187. Scene 1/69 depicts a social environment - an evening gathering at Mayor Vincy's
  - where the topic of the chaplaincy is raised before Lydgate again. The scene is shown
  much from his perspective and
  occasionally from Rosamond's. It opens with her close observation of her mother when
  she offers to refill Lydgate's glass <a href="PP.html#jollay" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-187"></a>. Davies advises that Rosmond will be 'anxious that he finds her mother
  vulgar and boring'. This is borne out in the Post-production speech where Davies injects
  a slightly vulgar speech for Mrs Vincy. This is delivered well in performance with
  Jacqueline Tong's affectatious pronunciation of the word
  'jolly' as 'jollay' in her lines to Lydgate and McDowell's visible flinch at this.
  There is a source for this in Lydgate's comparison of mother and daughter Vincy in
  Chapter 16 of the novel where this party takes place
  <a href="NO.html#mother-and-daughter" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-187"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-188"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">188. On the sidelines of the male characters' discussion of the chaplaincy, the stage
  directions note that Lydgate 'does his courteous listening bit' as both Tyke and Farebrother
  are criticised. In his portrayal
  of Lydgate, Hodge becomes even more pensive when Vincy expresses that he is glad no
  longer to be a board member, knowing 'whichever way I cast my vote I'd be offending
  someone'. In the novel Eliot lends Vincy the subtler
  phrase 'roll some of my responsibility onto your shoulders' with regard to Lydgate
  and his fellow doctors voting for the chaplaincy, whereas Davies makes the chance
  of offending someone his main message <a href="NO.html#Vincys-vote" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-188"></a>.
  This coheres dramatically with the message Bulstrode delivered loud and clear in Scene
  1/49.</p>


<p id="note-189"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">189. Lydgate's response comes across here more negatively than it does in the novel,
  where he makes it clear he is speaking generally <a href="NO.html#good-fellows" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-189"></a>. It also sounds more critical of Farebrother - and some plot reordering that occurs
  in
  Davies' adapation does not help in this regard. At this point in the novel, Lydgate
  has yet to visit Farebrother at home and bond with him over his scientific collections.
  In the
  adaptation this happened as far back as Scene 1/19 <a href="PP.html#beetles" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-189"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-190"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">190. The dramatic transition from Lydgate's slight disagreement with Chichely to his
  exchange with Farebrother is managed more creatively in the Post-production script.
  There 'A
  spurt of clapping and laughing' signals Farebrother has won at whist again and interrupts
  Lydgate before he can offer his conciliatory remark 'Well there we can agree' to Chichely.
  He has made another
  unfavourable impression in Middlemarch <a href="PP.html#we-can-agree" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-190"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-191"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">191. Davies shows Farebrother in his element at the Vincy's party but he steps aside
  from the card table in the Post-production script to check that he and Lydgate are
  still on good
  terms. The matter of the vote is not mentioned overtly between them in Chapter 16.
  Farebrother wittily invites Lydgate to the whist table - joking 'you are too young
  and light for this kind of thing'
  <a href="NO.html#too-light" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-191"></a>. This quip appears in Davies' scripts but is not delivered until Lydgate honestly
  owns that he has not made up his mind on how to vote and that without Farebrother
  he would
  'starve in this town for want of intelligent conversation' <a href="PP.html#starved" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-191"></a>. In this line, Davies harks back to their dialogue during their evening together
  in Scene 1/19.</p>


<p id="note-192"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">192. The next conversation that Lydgate is drawn into is altogether lighter. In the
  novel, his talk with Rosamond occurs both before and after he watches her play and
  sing. In the scripts
  their conversation, the first since they met as Stone Court in Scene 1/27, is condensed
  by Davies to a flirtatious interlude where Rosamond successfully draws Lydgate in.
  Her coy description of herself as a
  'just raw country girl' (similar to her alignment of herself with 'raw country girls'
  in the Chapter 16) <a href="NO.html#raw-girl" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-192"></a> elicits his compliments and enables her ostensibly to accept them shyly.
  The later teasing line about 'the rides towards Tipton and Lowick' is another hook
  (drawn verbatim from the novel) which Lydgate swallows with his response about 'meaning
  something much nearer to me'
  <a href="PP.html#Tipton-rides" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-192"></a>. Nevertheless, in the onscreen performances the chemistry between McDowell and Hodge
  makes this a moment of frisson for the audience.</p>


<p id="note-193"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">193. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  11 here <a href="assets/PF-11.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-193"></a>. The narrator steps back to talk about Destiny's part
  in the characters' outcomes ('our dramatis personae'). Rosamond, and the way her education
  has shaped her for upwards social mobility, becomes the narrator's focus.</p>


<p id="note-194"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">194. Davies' stage direction in the Shooting script refers to qualms that Lydgate
  expresses in the novel about Farebrother's seeming need to gamble and his success
  at this <a href="NO.html#water" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-194"></a>.
  This direction is lost from the Post-production script and Farebrother's next win
  is more of a distraction from Rosamond for Lydgate. Farebrother is also shown drinking
  wine in the onscreen version where Lydgate notices
  he drinks only water when he plays cards <a href="PP.html#wins-again" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-194"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-195"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">195. The motif of the town bridge is used by Davies several times in the Shooting
  script as the place where Lydgate stops briefly to contemplate a looming issue or
  change in his life.
  Probably due to the constraints of the actual location in Stamford, the bridge is
  usually replaced, as here, by a night-time walk home throught the streets <a href="PP.html#town-bridge" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-195"></a>. In
  Chapter 16, Lydgate contemplates both Rosamond and marriage on his way home and Farebrother
  and the vote <a href="NO.html#walking-home" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-195"></a>. In the Shooting script Davies' stage direction seems to suggest
  it is Rosamond who his uppermost in his mind.</p>


<p id="note-196"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">196. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  15 here <a href="assets/PF-12.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-196"></a>. The narrator presents themselves as the local historian of Middlemarch. Rather
  than Fielding's great historian of earlier novels, they are concerned with 'unravelling
  certain human lots' rather than Fielding's 'tempting range of relevencies called the
  universe'. This enables the narrator to turn to
  'the new settler' in 'this particular web' - and gives his backstory.</p>


<p id="note-197"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">197. Back at his lodgings, Lydgate's late-night experiments on tissue continue in
  the Shooting script but in the Post-production script this is interrupted by voiced-over
  recollections of
  the words and warnings of both Farebrother and Bulstrode as he struggles to decide
  which way he will vote <a href="PP.html#words-warnings" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-197"></a>. In the novel, less visually engagingly, Lydgate merely casts
  aside his book as he ponders his scientific calling and then thoughts of his evening
  at the Vincys' <a href="NO.html#casts-aside" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-197"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-198"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">198. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  15 here. <a href="assets/PF-13.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-198"></a>. The narrator reflects on how any human with high ideals can be derailed by
  ordinariness of by love and generalises about how easily this happens over time, as
  if by osmosis. This leads to an exploration of Lydgate's professional aims and introduces
  the story of Lydgate's time in Paris.</p>


<p id="note-199"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">199. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  15 here <a href="assets/PF-14.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-199"></a>. The narrator looks back 40 years from her standpoint of 1870 to what was thought

  and understood scientifically in the late 1820s.</p>


<p id="note-200"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">200. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  16 here <a href="assets/PF-15.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-200"></a>. The narrator offers the reader insights into the social aspirations driving Rosamond's

  ideas of marrying Lydgate.</p>


<p id="note-201"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">201. In the Post-production script this scene (1/73) depicting Brooke's arrival at
  the old infirmary is no longer included. Instead, Brooke enters on a simple stage
  direction. The reordering
  of scenes between the two iterations of the script is the cause of this <a href="PP.html#Brookes-entry" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-201"></a>. It was decided to end Episode 1 with the voting scene at the Hospital board meeting
  rather than the early scenes of the Casaubon's wedding trip
  to Rome. In the Post-production script the Rome scenes intervene between Scene 1/72
  and 1/74. This also signals the passing of more time between the events in these scenes
  <a href="PP.html#intervening-Rome" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-201"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-202"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">202. The impressive location for the Old Infirmary Board meetings is the Great Hall
  at Browne's Hospital, Stamford, itself founded in medieval times. The production gives
  the impression
  that this room is on the first floor - with Lydgate's entrance to this scene. It is
  in fact on the ground floor of Browne's hospital <a href="image.html?asset=P-222.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-202"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-203"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">203. Dr Minchin is among the 'town worthies' attending the hospital board meeting
  in the Shooting script. By the
  Post-production script, Minchin has disappeared <a href="PP.html#Minchin-disappears" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-203"></a>. Chichely who has previously appeared in Scene
  1/64 takes his place. This is change could be purely pragmatic, avoiding the need
  for another acting part, but it also has the effect of
  changing the number of doctors present from four in the novel to only one (Wrench).
  Eliot uses the discussion among the doctors in Chapter
  XVIII to show the antipathy for him that Lydgate has aroused among all the Middlemarch
  medical men <a href="NO.html#antipathy-for-Lydgate" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-203"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-204"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">204. Watch how Scene 1/74 unfolds after the arrival of Mr Brooke to form the culmination
  of Episode 1. <a href="assets/F-09.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-204"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-205"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">205. Dr Minchin's line of disparaging dialogue about Bulstrode nurturing Lydgate is
  reallocated to Chichely in the Post-production script
  <a href="PP.html#Lydgate-Bulstrodes-protege" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-205"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-206"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">206. Lydgate's arrival is signalled by a simple stage direction in the Shooting script.
  This changes in the Post-production script with the introduction of Scene 1/74a
  which depicts Lydgate hurriedly bounding up the stairs to the meeting, thus ramping
  up the tension of the voting scene and providing a visual break from the board room
  for the viewer. The
  staircase up from the cloisters at Browne's Hospital, Stamford, offered an atmospheric
  backdrop for this additional scene <a href="image.html?asset=P-224.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-206"></a>
  <a href="PP.html#bounding-upstairs" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-206"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-207"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">207. Bulstrode has the final word in Episode 1. Andrew Davies allots him the lines
  that Eliot gives to her narrrator in Chapter 18,
  confirming Tyke's appointment as chaplain <a href="NO.html#Bulstrode-as-narrator" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-207"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-208"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">208. There is a longer commentary on this scene, here <a href="CO.html#comment-115" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-208"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-209"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">209. The location of this short establishing scene works so much more effectively
  in the Post-production script version. There
  it signals not only the shift from night to day and from Middlemarch to Rome but also
  symbolises the dawn of Casaubon and Dorothea's married life
  together <a href="PP.html#Rome-dawn" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-209"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-210"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">210. Rome was the first location where shooting took place in early 1993. In interview
  script-editor, Susie Conklin (formerly Chapman) discusses
  how the sheer size of the budget (£6 million) for the series surprised some but that
  the experienced producer, Louis Marks provided a steady hand to steer this ship
  <a href="assets/I-01-T-03.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-210"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/104" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-210"></a>. Conklin observes that, with such an 'epic' production, the way the budget is used
  needs to be flexible and often the scripts
  need to be adapted to suit the practicalities of the location <a href="assets/I-01-T-05.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-210"></a>
  <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/104" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-210"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-211"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">211. This scene is omitted from the Post-production script, probably due to the lack
  of time available on
  location in Rome. Julie Edwards (Production manager) explains how scene cuts and changes
  were negotiated while on location between
  her and Susie Chapman (Script editor) to match time and budget constraints <a href="assets/I-03-T-02.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-211"></a>
  <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/104" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-211"></a>. Instead,
  elements of Scenes 1/76-80 are revised into new Scenes 1/76-78 in the Post-production
  script to suit the locations available to the
  producers <a href="PP.html#reduction-rome-scenes" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-211"></a>. This results in some wholesale changes to dialogue and reduces the number
  of spoken parts for the Roman street characters.</p>


<p id="note-212"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">212. A candid image of Director Anthony Page and Patrick Malahide (Casaubon), in the
  little square where Scene 1/76 is shot, shows a much
  happier aspect than the Davies' stage direction for Casaubon to look 'more like death
  than ever'<a href="image.html?asset=P-204.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-212"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-213"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">213. This short scene in the Shooting script focuses on Dorothea's reaction to grimy
  streets and then to the splendour of
  antiquities of Rome whereas the Post-production script brings in lines of courtly
  compliment from Casaubon to Dorothea <a href="PP.html#see-Rome-as-bride" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-213"></a>
  taken verbatim from Chapter 20 of the novel <a href="NO.html#see-Rome-die" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-213"></a>. On screen, Aubrey conveys Dorothea's look of kindly consideration at her husband's
  attempts
  to keep her happy.</p>


<p id="note-214"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">214. There is more about Dorothea's reaction to the madonna and child statue in the
  church she has visited
  in Commentary 9 <a href="CO.html#comment-120" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-214"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-215"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">215. It is from this point in Shooting script Scene 1/79 that the script is rewritten
  to suit the actual location with Casaubon
  referring here to visiting the Campidoglio next but in the Post-production script
  to the Palazzo Doria Pamphili <a href="PP.html#Doria-Pamphili" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-215"></a>.
  Dorothea's concern that Casaubon will be too fatigued is a constant across both scenes.
  And Davies' stage direction in the Shooting script - 'Oh God.
  They are both having such an awful time' - is conveyed just as well in the Post-production
  script by the stiff manner in which Casaubon 'holds out his
  arm to Dorothea' to urge her onwards.</p>


<p id="note-216"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">216. View the onscreen version of Dorothea and Casaubon touring the antiquities in
  Rome, here <a href="assets/F-07.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-216"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-217"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">217. Andrew Davies selects events from Chapters 19 and 20 in the novel to form Scenes
  1/82 to 1/84 in the Shooting script. In turn, these are
  combined into a single museum gallery location in Scene 1/83 in the Post-production
  script <a href="PP.html#top-of-scene-1-82" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-217"></a>.
  Chapter 19 begins with Naumanm drawing Ladislaw's attention to Dorothea standing pensively
  in the Vatican Museum. Chapter 20 finds Dorothea weeping back
  at her lodgings in Rome and fills in the story of how she came to be standing alone
  in the museum <a href="NO.html#Dorothea-sobbing" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-217"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-218"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">218. Elements of this conversation between Dorothea and Casaubon take place earlier
  in time in the novel, in Chapter 20 during
  another visit to the antiquities <a href="NO.html#Dorothea-care-for-it" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-218"></a>. However, Davies invents this speech about Cupid and Psyche in the
  Shooting script and the statue of Apollo in the Post-production script to show how
  Casaubon can make even the most romantic subjects dull.
  <a href="PP.html#Apollo-speech" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-218"></a></p>


<p id="note-219"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">219. Dorothea's question to Casaubon also belongs to their earlier conversation at
  the antiquities in the novel, but Davies
  borrows it here to give Casaubon his exit to the Vatican library. In fact he has taken
  himself to the library alone in Chapter 20 of the novel after
  their argument and she is accompanied only by her ladies maid, Tantripp, to the hall
  of statues <a href="NO.html#Tantripp-hall-of-statues" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-219"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-220"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">220. Stage directions in the Shooting script have Naumann viewing the back of Dorothea;
  the Post-production script clarifies
  this with Brian Tufano's cinematography capturing her in a side view, lit by light
  from the museum window<a href="PP.html#Naumann-views-Dor" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-220"></a>.
  Dorothea's costume transforms from a 'Quakerish grey' in the novel to a grey-blue
  in the screen version, connecting
  to Naumann's wish to paint her as a nun <a href="NO.html#model-for-a-nun" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-220"></a>. Rather than staring out of a window at the fast retreating
  Casaubon, in Chapter 19 she seems transfixed by a sliver of sunlight on the floor
  of the museum by the sensual statue of Cleopatra<a href="NO.html#sliver-of-light" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-220"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-221"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">221. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  19 here <a href="assets/PF-16.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-221"></a>. The narrator provides historical
  context before zooming in on Dorothea’s honeymoon and on Will who is a ‘youth of other
  nations’ in Rome.</p>


<p id="note-222"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">222. Davies chooses to reveal that Ladislaw is Naumann's companion in a more compactly
  dramatic way to Eliot's revelation. In the
  screened version, his back is to the audience and he turns quickly to join Nauman
  in an anteroom doorway.<a href="PP.html#Naumann-summons-Lad" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-222"></a>
  In Chapter 19, Naumann runs off to find Ladislaw in a less dramatic and immediate
  fashion to lead him to the hall of statues <a href="NO.html#Naumann-finds-Lad" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-222"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-223"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">223. Ladislaw's blander response in the Shooting script to Naumann's demand about
  Dorothea: 'Get her for me' reverts in the
  Post-production script <a href="PP.html#Confound-Naumann" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-223"></a> to his more impassioned response from the
  novel <a href="NO.html#Confound-you-Naumann" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-223"></a>. On screen, he blurts out 'Confound you' and then reins himself back for the rest
  of the speech, as
  if surprised by his own strength of feeling. This seems more in keeping with Ladislaw's
  own recognition at the end of Chapter 20 that on seeing
  Dorothea in Rome something changes fundamentally in him <a href="NO.html#Rome-fundamental" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-223"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-224"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">224. There is a longer commentary on Scenes 1/83-1/84 here <a href="CO.html#comment-120" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-224"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-225"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">225. Many of Davies' stage directions in Shooting script Scene 1/85, indicating strongly
  that the sexual side of the Casaubons' marriage is
  non-existent, are omitted from the much shorter scene in the Post-production script.
  These include Dorothea's poignant question as she prepares to go to bed with
  her new husband: 'why should she feel like sighing, or weeping? But she does, she
  does' <a href="PP.html#sighing-weeping" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-225"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-226"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">226. Davies goes further in Scene 1/85 of the Shooting script to spell out Casaubon's
  fear of his wife's 'youth, her energy, her intelligence,
  and her sexuality' in their pre-sleep dialogue. All of this implication in the stage
  direction is removed from the Post-production script and the action cuts
  straight to the start of Scene 1/86 with Casaubon asleep in bed <a href="PP.html#cut-to-Cas-asleep" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-226"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-227"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">227. Where Casaubon is noted as 'sleeping like a corpse' in both scripts, the implication
  could be that he is playing dead to escape physical intimacy.
  A subtle difference between the stage directions is that when Dorothea touches him
  in the Shooting script he turns away from her 'Even in his sleep' whereas in the
  Post-production script and on screen it is much less certain that he is asleep when
  he turns away <a href="PP.html#turns-away" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-227"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-228"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">228. The voiced-over start of the next morning's conversation between the Casaubons
  segues neatly from Dorothea's late night perusal of the notebooks to her
  introduction of them to their talk next day. This may have been a creative decision
  by the producer or a pragmatic editing decision to shave seconds off the episode
  length or a mixture of both <a href="PP.html#notebooks-segue" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-228"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-229"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">229. Davies embeds a tacit joke here - punning on Carp (an academic adversary of Casaubon's)
  <a href="NO.html#Carp" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-229"></a> and his research into ancient
  'fish deities' <a href="NO.html#fish-deities" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-229"></a>. Both are mentioned independently in the novel but the screenwriter brings them together
  here. In both scripts Casaubon
  delivers this line 'entirely to himself'. The Shooting script implies he is hiding
  from Dorothea by 'taking comfort from his petty feud with Carp'. But in performance,

  Malahide delivers the line with a lightness, almost to deflect Dorothea from her line
  of argument about his work - a ploy which does not work <a href="PP.html#is-it-not-time" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-229"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-230"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">230. Casaubon's use of 'My love' to Dorothea is never a term of endearment but one
  of censure. Davies produces an adaptation filleted from the novel of the
  first major argument between the couple <a href="NO.html#angry-flush" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-230"></a>. Davies' particular screen-writing skill of ensuring 'dramatic background' to Eliot's
  dialogue is highlighted
  in interview by Susie Conklin (fomerly Chapman) <a href="assets/I-01-T-02.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-230"></a><a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/104" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-230"></a>. Certainly Malahide's performance leaves viewers in no doubt of Casaubon's channelled
  fury, reflecting
  Eliot's own narration of this in Chapter 20.</p>


<p id="note-231"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">231. The Post-production script remains very close to the dialogue in the Shooting
  script except that in the later script,
  Casaubon interrupts his wife meaning she has to repeat that, in the circumstances,
  her judgment could only be a 'superficial one'. In this way, Dorothea has
  the last word both in the novel and the adaptation <a href="PP.html#superficial" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-231"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-232"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">232. Episode 1 in the Shooting script ends with Scene 1/87 on the first strong
  representation of conflict between Dorothea and Casaubon. In the Post-production script,
  Episode 1 ends with
  Lydgate's vote for Tyke and his first humiliation by the Middlemarchers. The Post-production
  script
  bookends Episode 1 with the Lydgate plot <a href="PP.html#change-to-end-Ep1" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-232"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-233"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">233. Andrew Davies uses the cover of the Episode 2 Shooting script to record the main
  changes he proposes to make: in this case to include elements of the horsefair
  episode in Chapter 23 of the novel; to look again at script pages 2/87 and 2/90; to
  end the Episode with Rosamond and Lydgate <a href="image.html?asset=A-01.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-233"></a>
  <a href="assets/A-01-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-233"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-233"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-234"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">234. The opening of the new Middlemarch Fever hospital was originally designed in
  the Shooting script to open Episode 2. Instead it follows
  scenes depicting the latter part of the Casaubons' honeymoon in Rome, in the Post-production
  script <a href="PP.html#Fever-Hosp" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-234"></a> <a href="assets/F-12.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-234"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-235"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">235. The location for the new Fever hospital was Barn Hill House in Stamford, then
  a privately-owned property. The stone exterior was cleaned especially to give the
  impression
  that this Georgian buiding had only just been constructed <a href="image.html?asset=P-57.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-235"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-236"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">236. A crucial but also integral part of the mise-en-scène for Scene 2/1 which brings
  the viewer back to Middlemarch from Rome, is the banner that forms
  the backdrop for Mayor Vincy as he delivers his speech of welcome to the opening of
  the town's new hospital. Gerry Scott's design was the key to the creation of this
  prop
  which effectively sur-titles the scene <a href="image.html?asset=PM-33.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-236"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-237"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">237. The detail in Davies' Shooting script stage direction that 'A little knot of
  other doctors go humph' in reaction to Lydgate being appointed as medical supervisor
  is a reminder of the negative feeling he has begun to engender among his fellow professionals
  in Middlemarch. This useful recap is however omitted from the Post-production script
  -
  perhaps due to the casting of fewer doctors than was originally intended. Dr Minchin,
  for example <a href="PP.html#doctors-go-humpf" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-237"></a>. On screen, the omission also has the positive effect
  of concentrating the viewer's gaze on Rosamond's approving glance towards Lydgate.</p>


<p id="note-238"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">238. Hawley's comment that the chaplaincy should have gone to Farebrother provides
  a neat reminder to the viewer of the climactic scene in Episode 1 where Lydgate acts
  out of pride in voting
  for Tyke rather than Farebrother <a href="PP.html#hawleys-reminder" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-238"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-239"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">239. Scene 2/1 is shortened between the Shooting script and the Post-production script
  from this point onwards. Brooke's speech here becomes more specific in the Post-production
  as Davies replaces the character's habitual references to 'moderation' with particular

<p id="note-242"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">242. This short scene in the Shooting script depicting Dorothea sobbing in response
  to her breakfast argument with Casaubon is cut from the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#scene-2.3-cut" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-242"></a>. The
  propensity here, which can also be noted elsewhere in the fine-tuning of the adaptation,
  is for scenes where Dorothea shows excess emotion to be cut. Davies consciously reduces
  the number of times this occurs between the
  novel and his Shooting script. Dorothea's sobbing opens Chapter 20 of the novel <a href="NO.html#scene1-excess-emotion" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-242"></a> and is returned to by Eliot later in that chapter (p.298) marking it as a significant

  point in her protagonist's relationship with Casaubon <a href="NO.html#scene2-excess-emotion" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-242"></a>. (Such scenes are pruned further between the Shooting script and the final
  script as in this case.)</p>


<p id="note-243"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">243. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  20 here <a href="assets/PF-17.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-243"></a>. The narrator effects a time shift back from events of Chapter 19 to give an explanation
  of
  why Dorothea is crying on her honeymoon. </p>


<p id="note-244"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">244. Also cut between the Shooting script and the Post-production script are the opening
  comments in the conversation between Dorothea and Ladislaw in Scene 2/4. Instead this
  opens in media res
  which brings more immediacy to their encounter <a href="PP.html#immediacy-inmediares" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-244"></a>. Dorothea is not overtly shown to have been upset and crying, though her eyes reflect
  some degree of heightened emotion as the scene begins.</p>

<p id="note-246"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">246. In interview, Davies refers to the non-realistic interior soundscapes he at first
  intended to include in the script of which this scene in the Vatican
  library is an example, representing Casaubon's mental disorientation after his argument
  with Dorothea <a href="image.html?asset=PM-56.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-246"></a> <a href="assets/pm-56-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-246"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-246"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-247"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">247. Composer Chris Gunning, in interview, reflects on how the extra-diegetic music
  associated with Casaubon darkens from this point in Episode 2 <a href="image.html?asset=PM-66.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-247"></a>

  21 here <a href="assets/PF-18.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-248"></a>. Eliot's narrator uses prolepsis, to show that Dorothea recalls this moment of revelation

  and the lesson she took from it for the rest of her life. Eliot gives her protagonist
  an afterlife beyond the bounds of the novel in such instances which brings psychological
  realism to her characterisation. </p>


<p id="note-249"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">249. Naumann's confidence in his impressive studio setting, persuades Casaubon to
  sit for him as Thomas Aquinas and allows Ladislaw time to talk with Dorothea.
  The split location of the artist's studio and the exterior balcony enhances this effect
  in the Post-production script and the onscreen version <a href="assets/F-13.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-249"></a>
  <a href="PP.html#split-location" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-249"></a>. In the Shooting script Naumann's single larger studio contains all the characters
  - Dorothea and Ladislaw stand apart by a window to talk.</p>


<p id="note-250"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">250. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  22 here <a href="assets/PF-19.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-250"></a>. The narrator moves closer to Ladislaw's narrative perspective, revaling how the
  strength
  of his feelings for Dorothea modifies his more usual tolerance of the objectification
  of women. </p>


<p id="note-251"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">251. There is a longer commentary on Scenes 2/9-2/12 here <a href="CO.html#comment-160" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-251"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-252"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">252. The end of Scene 2/12 corresponds with the end of Book 2 (Ch.22) of the novel

<p id="note-253"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">253. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  23 here <a href="assets/PF-20.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-253"></a>. Eliot's generalising narrator, using the
  inclusive pronoun ‘we’, raises an issue, in this case, "Who does a person go to when
  they need to ask a favour and with what motivations?". The focus is then narrowed
  to Fred and what he chooses to
  do in this situation.</p>


<p id="note-254"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">254. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  23 here <a href="assets/PF-21.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-254"></a>. The narrator observes a minor event -
  three men leaving town on horseback – from both inside and out. It is viewed as if
  by the townsfolk of Middllemarch but also from Fred's perspective with regard to how
  he might justify why he
  keeps company on such an outing with Bambridge and Horrocks.</p>


<p id="note-255"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">255. The amount of money that Mary Garth counts out to settle Fred's debt differs
  between £24 in the Shooting script and £18 in the
  Post-production script <a href="PP.html#eighteen-pounds" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-255"></a>. From Chapter 25 in the novel it is clear that her parents need her to pay £18 and
  so this may
  account for the change. It is enough here for Mary to state that she has £6 left of
  her savings, and quietly put these away. The visual torment for
  Fred of watching her count out the money he will take from her is well-delivered on
  screen. Mary even has to give him the last pound in coins
  <a href="assets/F-14.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-255"></a>. In the novel Eliot spares Fred this indignity - as Mary hands the money to her father
  later in the
  chapter <a href="NO.html#Marys-savings" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-255"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-256"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">256. In this exchange between Mary and Fred, Davies makes it clear that she won't
  absolve him of the responsibility of getting
  into debt as he seeks to explain this away as 'terrible luck'. Davies takes Fred's
  reference early in Chapter 25 to his lack of luck <a href="NO.html#lack-of-luck" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-256"></a> and
  gives Mary a retort that makes Fred aware that what is 'bad luck' for him changes
  the course of others' lives seriously for the worse <a href="PP.html#people-suffer" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-256"></a>.
  Mary understands these consequences all to clearly and Fred due to selfishness, is
  blind to them.</p>


<p id="note-257"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">257. Davies carefully chooses contrasting language of emotion and reaction for Mary
  and for Fred in this conversation, Fred's always being
  the more extreme. His overly dramatic question 'Do you hate me now?', typical of the
  spoilt son of the Vincys, meets with Mary's measured response 'I
  don't think well of you' which still manages to reveal a sliver of positivity towards
  him in the 'well'. Fred responds with the hyperbolic 'I don't think I could
  live...', the stock response of a potentially spurned lover.</p>


<p id="note-258"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">258. In giving her reasons why she cannot hate Fred, Mary reveals that she values
  people most who show empathy and who
  like her irrespective of her social position or theirs, just as Fred does. But she
  then counters that she could not marry a man unless she could respect him.
  Davies uses 'respect' - more of a 1990s frame of reference for choosing a husband
  - whereas Eliot is content for Mary to tell Fred how selfish his conduct has been.
  Only
  to her father, later in Chapter 25, does she confirm that she will not marry Fred
  while he has 'no manly independence' <a href="NO.html#manly-independence" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-258"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-259"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">259. Mary's parting comment in the Shooting script about Fred being 'stupidly selfish',
  though reflecting her dialogue with him in the novel
  <a href="NO.html#selfish-Fred" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-259"></a>, is lost from the Post-production script. Instead the music swells as Mary delivers
  her last speech and when she disappears
  upstairs to tend to Featherstone, the camera rests on the forlorn Fred <a href="PP.html#stupidly-selfish" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-259"></a>. In interview, Andrew Davies reveals much more about
  how he shaped Mary's dialogue and how Rachel Power's performance in the role significantly
  enhanced this <a href="image.html?asset=PM-55.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-259"></a>

<p id="note-260"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">260. In interview, composer Chris Gunning, explains his choice of musical theme for

<p id="note-262"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">262. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  26 here <a href="assets/PF-22.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-262"></a>. The omniscient narrator gathers up and
  reports the views of Middlemarch on a particular incident – in this case Lydgate's
  replacement of Wrench as doctor to the Vincys.</p>


<p id="note-263"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">263. Andrew Davies annotated this page with a reminder to introduce a 'bad-horse'
  scene. An intriguing place to note this because Fred has
  already fallen ill at this point in the Shooting script after his horse-buying encounter
  in Scene 2/17 <a href="image.html?asset=A-02.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-263"></a>

<p id="note-264"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">264. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  27 here <a href="assets/PF-23.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-264"></a>. The narrator takes an extended metaphor
  (sometimes scientific, often philosophical) and applies it to a particular character
  of her own – in this case Rosamond.</p>


<p id="note-265"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">265. Lighting cameraman, Brian Tufano remarks in interview that locations can be employed
  carefully to tell part of the story or reflect a particular character. He mentions
  Bympton D'Evercy
  and Casaubon as an example of making a residence an objective correlative for a character
  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-96.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-265"></a> <a href="assets/PM-96-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-265"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-265"></a>.
  In this case, Davies extensive stage directions about the gloomy nature of Lowick
  on the Casaubons' return from honeymoon perfectly supports this idea. These stage
  directions have been culled in the Post-production script because the onscreen visuals

  say it all <a href="PP.html#gloomy-visuals" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-265"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-266"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">266. Andrew Davies makes an alteration to Brooke's speech about Ladislaw to avoid
  a repetition of the phrase 'young men with bold ideas' from
  an earlier speech <a href="image.html?asset=A-03.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-266"></a> <a href="assets/A-03-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-266"></a>

  where speeches from the short 2/31 are subsumed into Scene 2/29 <a href="PP.html#men-bold-ideas" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-266"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-267"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">267. Davies invents this scene, bringing the Reverend Farebrother to Mary with news
  of Fred's recovery which parallels his later role
  in Episodes 3 and 5 as emissary for Fred, and echoes the earlier hallway meeting in
  Scene 2/21A between Fred and Mary <a href="assets/F-16.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-267"></a>.
  Instead in the novel Fred recuperates at Stonecourt after his illness, accompanied
  by Mrs Vincy <a href="NO.html#Freds-recuperation" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-267"></a>. In the Shooting script the two
  hallway scenes are interrupted only by the plotline of Fred's illness which brings
  Lydgate and Rosamond together more often. In the Post-production script Scenes 2/46-2/54

  intervene as well, portraying the Casaubons' increasingly fraught relationship, Casaubon's
  sudden collapse and Dorothea requesting Brooke to write to Ladislaw to stop
  him returning to Middlemarch <a href="PP.html#Dors-request" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-267"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-268"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">268. The stage direction in the Shooting script, gives such detailed notes on how
  Mary reacts to news of Fred being out of danger.
  These are later abbreviated in the Post-production script to remove some of the interiority
  <a href="PP.html#hugs-joy" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-268"></a>. Even so, reflected clearly but reservedly in Rachel Power's performance is
  Davies' original direction that 'she somehow hug her joy to herself for a moment'
  before she responds in her 'usual sharp-tongued mode'. Davies,in his interview, shows
  his
  admiration for Power's depth of interpretation as Mary Garth - a character that he
  initially found it harder than most to write <a href="image.html?asset=PM-55.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-268"></a>
  <a href="assets/pm-55-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-268"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-268"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-269"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">269. The Shooting script ends this scene more abruptly with Farebrother's implicative
  line 'Except one, perhaps' than the Post-production script. In this,
  Farebrother collects himself enough to bring the conversation back to Fred's recovery
  and Mary to thank him <a href="PP.html#except-one" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-269"></a>. On-screen, these extra lines are paced to allow the camera to move
  between Mary and Farebrother, reflecting their unspoken understanding and showing
  how Mary's empathy for him in her gaze as the recorder and string theme associated
  with her plays.</p>


<p id="note-270"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">270. There is a longer commentary on Scene 2/37 and the earlier Stone Court hallway
  scene with Mary and Fred (2/20-21a), here

<p id="note-271"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">271. In interview, Director Anthony Page reveals how the actors were auditioned not
  from Davies' script but using dialogue from the novel. This party scene at the Vincys'
  would have offered
  prime material for auditioning <a href="NO.html#Plymdale-flirtation" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-271"></a>. Although it seems Page and Marks came to regret their strategy when the cast kept

<p id="note-272"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">272. The frontage of the new Fever Hospital is employed once more as a backdrop, this
  time as the start of Lydgate and Bulstrode's walk-and-talk about the doctor's

  29 here <a href="assets/PF-24.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-274"></a>. The narrator questions overtly
  why the dominant narrative perspective should be Dorothea’s. Instead the reader is
  offered some reflection on the marriage from Casaubon's point of view. This does not
  translate into the TV adaptation.</p>


<p id="note-275"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">275. There is something of the Gothic in the library scenes that lead up to Casaubon's

<p id="note-276"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">276. In interview, director Anthony Page, talks about how challenging it was to convey

  <a href="assets/A-04-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-278"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-278"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-279"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">279. Andrew Davies' annotations to this page signal that he wishes a) to change
  the ending of Episode 2 to Lydgate's hasty proposal to Rosamond and b) that he proposes
  to alter
  Brooke's lines in this scene so that the letter-writing scene inviting Ladislaw to
  Middlemarch
  can be omitted <a href="image.html?asset=A-05.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-279"></a> <a href="assets/A-05-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-279"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-279"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-280"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">280. The faint annotation 'In the street' at the very start of Scene 2/55, seems to
  indicate Davies was toying with a change of location for Lydgate and Rosamond who

  rarely meet outside <a href="image.html?asset=A-06.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-280"></a> <a href="assets/A-06-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-280"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-280"></a>.
  However, the interior setting for the scene was retained in the Post-production script
  <a href="PP.html#in-the-street" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-280"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-281"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">281. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  31 here <a href="assets/PF-25.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-281"></a>. Even during the intimate Lydgate-Rosamond proposal, the narrative voice is strong,

  with the direct address to the reader to ‘Remember’ Lydgate’s contrasting qualities.
  And, although the narrator protests Rosamond's actions and reactions are natural here,
  she still behaves perfomatively.</p>


<p id="note-282"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">282. As with the final scene in Episode 1, the climactic scene to Episode 2, railroads
  Lydgate into a decision that he might not have taken in a more considered moment.
  The pace of the scene and Douglas Hodge's portrayal of
  Lydgate's impetuous nature, make it easy to accept, as George Eliot notes in Chapter
  31, that after only 30 minutes he emerges from the Vincys' 'an engaged man, whose
  soul was not his own' <a href="NO.html#engaged-man" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-282"></a>

<p id="note-283"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">283. Douglas Hodge reveals, in interview, how productive it was to have had previous
  acting experiences with Trevyn McDowell for their portrayal of Lydgate and Rosamond

  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-70.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-283"></a> <a href="assets/pm-70-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-283"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-283"></a>. He also explains how they designed the blocking of the scene to portray how the
  characters
  need to overcome the social barrier set up between them and the resulting proposal
  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-69.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-283"></a> <a href="assets/pm-69-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-283"></a>

<p id="note-284"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">284. In interview, composer Chris Gunning, explains the way he wrote the extra-diegetic
  music for the Lydgate-Rosamond proposal scene to reflect the characters' changing
  emotions
  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-68.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-284"></a> <a href="assets/pm-68-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-284"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-284"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-285"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">285. There is a longer commentary to this scene here <a href="CO.html#comment-180" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-285"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-286"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">286. Andrew Davies uses the cover of the Episode 3 Shooting script to record the main
  changes he proposes to make: in this case the probability
  of opening the episode with Ladislaw's return to Middlemarch and to look again at
  script pages 47, 85, 94, 104, 105 <a href="image.html?asset=A-07.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-286"></a>

An insight into Davies'
  first ideas for shaping Episode 3 can be found in his Notes made in 1991 <a href="image.html?asset=PM-99.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-286"></a>

<p id="note-287"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">287. Instead of Davies' proposal in his handwritten annotations to the Shooting script
  for a bright opening to this episode with Ladislaw's arrival back in Middlemarch
  <a href="image.html?asset=A-08.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-287"></a> <a href="assets/A-08-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-287"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-287"></a>,
  the Post-production script begins with Featherstone's death <a href="assets/F-19.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-287"></a>. This remains close to the original opening of the Shooting script, where the Waules
  continue
  to visit the old man during his decline <a href="PP.html#Waules-decline" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-287"></a>. These scenes 3/5-3/7 are instead moved in the Post-production script to near the
  end of Episode 2 <a href="PP.html#Waules-back-Ep2" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-287"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-288"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">288. Davies' description of the Waules and Featherstones as 'vultures' refers back
  to Fred's comment in Chapter 12 <a href="NO.html#first-vultures-ref" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-288"></a> of them 'hanging about' his uncle 'like vultures' and also to Eliot's extended
  metaphor of the animals' thoughts as they entered the ark, at the start of Chapter
  35 which depicts Featherstone's funeral <a href="NO.html#vultures-role" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-288"></a>. In a similar vein, Davies' stage direction
  describes Mrs Waule and Featherstone's brother as 'pair of giant bluebottles' at the
  start of Scene 3/7 <a href="PP.html#ark-metaphor" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-288"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-289"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">289. The parlour is packed with Featherstone's relatives, feasting and drinking tea
  at his expense as is narrated at length in Chapter 32 where Eliot underlines their
  parasitic nature <a href="NO.html#feasting-Waules" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-289"></a>
  and Mrs Vincy's assurances to Mary that they must be dealt with generously during
  their relative's 'last illness' <a href="NO.html#handsomely" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-289"></a>. Davies condenses much of this chapter into the short scenes 3/6-3/7 and in Scene
  3/8, which
  is cut between the Shooting script and the Post-production script, he references the
  'stuffed veal' and 'good cheese' that Mrs Vincy recommends is served in Chapter 32
  <a href="SS.html#good-cheese" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-289"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-290"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">290. The use of [OOV] sound in this brief scene effectively and evocatively reflects
  the eavesdropping that is prevalent in the Featherstone household in its master's
  last days. To enhance this effect the
  [OOV] dialogue is extended in the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#OOV-eavesdropping" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-290"></a>. Each of the many relatives around his dining table is alert to how Featherstone
  dismisses his nearest blood relatives from
  his chamber. But the viewer, also eavesdropping here, is then admitted to Featherstone's
  bedchamber in the following scene <a href="PP.html#viewer-admitted" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-290"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-291"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">291. In interview, production manager, Julie Edwards reports how actor Michael Hordern
  was elderly and infirm, like his character Featherstone, and needed to stay on location
  at Stragglethorpe Hall
  (Stone Court) <a href="assets/I-03-T-03-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-291"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/104" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-291"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-292"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">292. In Chapter 32, the narrator ironically notes that Mrs Waule is herself affected
  by the 'touching' nature of her own thought about her children here <a href="NO.html#touching-thought" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-292"></a>.
  Her hypocrisy is that she and Solomon are wealthy enough not to need a legacy for
  their children. Davies only gives lines to these two richer siblings, the poorer Jonah
  and Cranch, nephew to Featherstone, he chooses to omit. He deems Solomon and
  Mrs Waule, as the two principal blood relatives of Featherstone, to be sufficient
  dramatically to show the jealousy towards the Vincys who preside in old man's chamber
  <a href="PP.html#Mrs-Vincy-favoured" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-292"></a>. When Mrs Waule implies
  insidiously that the Vincys are taking their place, the camera lingers on Mrs Vincy's
  offended face before Fred leaps up to offer that he and his mother could leave.</p>


<p id="note-293"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">293. While Mary is present in the Post-production scene, ushering Solmon and Mrs Waule
  in and out of Featherstone's chamber, she does not have a line as she does in the
  Shooting script and there is no exhange of glances
  between Mrs Vincy and Mary. Her role is more neutral in the finished production and
  it is Mrs Vincy who steps in to calm Featherstone with a gentle 'Ssh' as he demands
  his brother and sister get out <a href="PP.html#Ssh" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-293"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-294"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">294. Scene 3/8 is cut after the Shooting script but fragments of the dialogue from
  this short scene are subsumed into the end of Scene 3/7 in the Post-production script
  <a href="PP.html#fragments1" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-294"></a>. With this cut, the brother
  and sister's argument from Chapter 36 that the property should be left to the closest
  blood relative is also lost from the script <a href="NO.html#property-family" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-294"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-295"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">295. Davies omits from his adaptation the speculation that Mary Garth causes among
  the Featherstone relatives, and their interest in her as a possible match because
  she might be a legatee of the old man. Among them is Borthrop Trumbull,
  the Middlemarch auctioneer, who talks to Mary in Chapter 32 about Sir Walter Scott
  and offers to lend her books from his collection <a href="NO.html#Trumbull-Scott" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-295"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-296"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">296. Scene 3/10 which opens Episode 3 in the Post-production script, begins with Mary
  Garth dozing in the the chair before the fire <a href="PP.html#Ep3-start" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-296"></a>. This is in stark contrast with the novel where she sits musing on the
  day that has past and Eliot's narrator allows her to reflect on how she feels about
  her uncle and master, Peter Featherstone and his relatives <a href="NO.html#Mary-muses" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-296"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-297"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">297. Featherstone's instruction to Mary about burning the will and where she will
  find it are truncated by Davies between the Shooting script and the Post-production
  script <a href="PP.html#truncated-chest" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-297"></a>. Gone are the details
  of the 'iron chest' and the printed title of the will itself. With these cuts are
  lost a reference to novel, where in Chapter 32 Featherstone's relatives speculate
  that Mary will have access to his 'iron chests' <a href="NO.html#iron-chests" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-297"></a>. The irony
  being that when she does have the opportunity to open the iron chest, prized by others,
  she rejects it <a href="NO.html#burn-it" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-297"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-298"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">298. The opening line in this speech is omitted in the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#Shall-I-not" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-298"></a>, thus losing a link with the novel where the Eliot underlines the importance to Featherstone
  of retaining ultimate power over his
  legacy and his relatives to the very end <a href="NO.html#at-the-last" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-298"></a>. He has not however bargained for his sheer physical frailty and on Mary's strong
  moral sense in these final moments of his life. His sense of physical frustration
  is relayed in his
  throwing of the walking cane but his coughing fit that ends the conversation on screen
  does not show his complete defeat so well as Davies' stage directions that leave him
  'whimpering' and 'helpless' <a href="PP.html#whimpering" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-298"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-299"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">299. On screen, although when Mary wakes she acts quickly to check if Featherstone
  is dead, the camera also lingers over her reaction to his death. In contrast, Mary
  acts urgently in Chapter 33 of the novel to alert the household that her master
  has died <a href="NO.html#Marys-urgency" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-299"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-300"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">300. There is a longer commentary on Scenes 3/10-11 here <a href="CO.html#comment-185" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-300"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-301"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">301. The end of Scene 3/11 corresponds with the end of Book 3 (Ch.33) of the novel
  <a href="NO.html#end-of-book-3" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-301"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-302"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">302. Andrew Davies explains in interview that he considered cutting Mrs Cadwallader
  from his adaptation because she did not actively deliver a plot line but eventually
  resolved to retain her as she has so many telling lines of dialogue and brings such
  colour to the ensemble.
  Her line her about the 'wretched handloom weavers' carries real historical authenticity
  and comes from the equivalent scene in Chapter 34 of the novel <a href="NO.html#wretched-handloom" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-302"></a>. By contrast, he found he could cut the plot line that actively links Ladislaw to

  Bulstrode without hindering the plot development <a href="image.html?asset=PM-77.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-302"></a> <a href="assets/PM-77-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-302"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-302"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-303"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">303. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from the start
  of Chapter 34 here <a href="assets/PF-26.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-303"></a>. The narrator ruminates about Featherstone - supplying reasons for his malicious
  temperament,
  which is reflected in his funeral arrangements.</p>


<p id="note-304"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">304. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  34 here <a href="assets/PF-27.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-304"></a>. In a moment of prolepsis, the narrator notes that Dorothea will recall this funeral
  at 'sensitive points
  in memory' through her life, associating a despondent point in another family's life
  with a despondent point in her own.</p>


<p id="note-305"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">305. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  35 here <a href="assets/PF-28.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-305"></a>. Unusually using the pronoun 'one' rather than 'we', the narrator compares the 'Christian
  Carnivora' of
  Featherstone's family through an anthromorphic analogy with the animals boarding the
  Ark discussing how they could divide up the provisions, including some of their fellow
  travellers.</p>


<p id="note-306"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">306. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  37 here <a href="assets/PF-29.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-306"></a>. In placing events in Middlemarch in the context of a particular significant moment
  in history, Eliot's narrator
  moves from national politcal preoccupations to the confusion this is creating in the
  town through the two main newspapers' mixed messaging - the traditionally Tory <em>Trumpet</em> and the more Liberal <em>Pioneer</em>. She focuses all of this
  through the lens of one 'noticeable article' which will lead the reader to a discussion
  of Ladislaw's appointment at <em>The Pioneer</em>.</p>


<p id="note-307"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">307. Lydgate and Rosamond's onscreen wedding scene and the townsfolk's talk of this

<p id="note-308"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">308. As Standish makes this comment the camera flips to Brooke and Ladislaw as they

<p id="note-311"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">311. Davies' three recommendations for changes in his annotations to Shooting script,
  Scene 3/32, page 3/47, are reflected in the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#less-saintly" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-311"></a>:
  the dialogue between Dorothea and Ladislaw begins in media res; on screen, she is
  lighter in her mood around spending 'not all' her hours in the library; her final
  speech is curtailed to sound
  less tortured <a href="image.html?asset=A-09.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-311"></a> <a href="assets/A-09-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-311"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-311"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-312"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">312. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  37 here <a href="assets/PF-30.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-312"></a>. The narrator addresses the reader directly with 'you see'
  to emphasise a point about her protagonist. In this case that it is Dorothea's 'blindness'
  to social obstacles - 'things obvious to others' - which allows her to pursue her
  'pure purpose'.</p>


<p id="note-313"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">313. The changes Davies suggests in his annotations to Shooting script page 3/48 come
  into being in the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#abominable-softening" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-313"></a>:
  for example the rephrasing of Ladislaw's reference to his grandmother's abandonment
  by her family as 'abominable' instead of sounding as if Casaubon is included in the
  blame for this,
  acknowledges his recognition of it and makes Dorothea even more sympathetic to his
  family's plight. The script addition of her disinheritance being bound to the fact
  of 'merely falling in love
  with a poor man' is also affective <a href="image.html?asset=A-10.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-313"></a> <a href="assets/A-10-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-313"></a>

<p id="note-314"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">314. Director, Anthony Page discusses, in interview, how much more relaxed Juliet
  Aubrey and Rufus Sewell were with each other in this scene, shot late in the production
  schedule (August 1993) at Brymton D'Evercy, Somerset.
  In other scenes, shot earlier, the two actors were 'more formal' with one another
  and Page uses this as evidence that it is usually better for scenes to be shot in

<p id="note-316"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">316. Davies builds into these Shooting script stage directions a reference back to
  Ladislaw's intention to walk the five miles briskly over the wet grass to Tipton (from
  the previous scene and Chapter 37 of the novel) <a href="NO.html#wet-grass" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-316"></a>.
  This contrasts subtly with the introspective Casaubon's return to Lowick by coach.
  The young man has energy to burn off, whereas Dorothea's husband is sedentary and
  would not risk his health walking miles across 'wet grass'.</p>


<p id="note-317"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">317. Production designer, Gerry Scott explains what she considers important in terms

  at the start of the chapter by employing the analogy of an electric battery to observe
  cause and effect on a set of components. In this case the components are the Garths
  and the epigraph refers to Caleb's work ethic and diligence
  causing a change of fortune with his appointment to the estate management of Tipton.</p>

<p id="note-326"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">326. Davies' annotated page of the Shooting script reveals that he wished to make

  42 here <a href="assets/PF-33.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-327"></a>. The narrator examines Casaubon’s reasons for considering legal preventions to anyone
  else being happy once he is dead, and
  especially Ladislaw. The narration moves close to Casaubon's perspective before revealing
  how he masks from himself his own motives.</p>


<p id="note-328"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">328. Davies' annotated page of the Shooting script includes a change to the word 'particularly'
  to 'peculiarly' in the phrase 'particularly difficult to predict'. Here, the screenwriter
  is wishing to revert to the way Lydgate expresses this idea about Casaubon's heart

  disease to Dorothea in Chapter 30 of the novel <a href="NO.html#peculiarly" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-328"></a> <a href="image.html?asset=A-12.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-328"></a> <a href="assets/A-12-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-328"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-328"></a>.

  rank and values are represented through their attire. The narration also
  notes that, in these first moments, Dorothea's attention is so fully on Rosamond that
  she does not register 'the gentleman' present as Ladislaw.</p>


<p id="note-331"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">331. Davies' annotated page of the Shooting script suggests the slightly repetitive
  second use of the word 'must' is removed <a href="image.html?asset=A-13.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-331"></a> <a href="assets/A-13-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-331"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-331"></a>.

<p id="note-332"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">332. Davies' annotated page of the Shooting script suggests cutting the speech where

However, this neat condensation of the conversation from Chapter 44 <a href="NO.html#religious-tone" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-332"></a> remains intact in the Post-production script.

<p id="note-333"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">333. Scenes 3/73-75 appear in the Shooting script to depict the moment in Chapter
  46 of the novel where Ladislaw attends Lowick Church even when he has been forbidden
  to visit there. This comes
  after an evening where, having been ‘mortified’ by Dorothea's discovery of him alone
  at home with Rosamond Lydgate, he wrestles with his feelings in a lengthy passage
  of narrative introspection. Here Ladislaw, the romantic, fantasises over Dorothea

  precisely because of her unavailability: ‘What others might have called the futility
  of his passion, made an additional delight for his imagination’ <a href="NO.html#futility-passion" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-333"></a>. Following this, he resolves he will see her in church the next
  morning.</p>


<p id="note-334"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">334. Davies' script includes Casaubon reading the bible lesson. Whereas in Chapter
  46 Casaubon is not preaching at the service Ladislaw attends and so sits with Dorothea
  <a href="NO.html#not-preaching" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-334"></a>. This enables the delivery of a message via
  Casaubon's voiced-over reading of a message that carries connotations for Ladislaw:
  as an adult one should 'put away childish things'. Casaubon's reading spans across
  Scenes 3/73-75, where there is no dialogue, symbolically rendering Ladislaw speechless

  in the presence of Dorothea.</p>


<p id="note-335"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">335. In the novel, Ladislaw sits himelf in Tucker's pew (Lowick's curate) but the
  Tucker family do not attend and he is left conspicuously alone <a href="NO.html#seated-alone" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-335"></a> just as Davies seats him in the Shooting script.
  The set-up for these scenes at St Andrew's Church, Brympton d'Evercy would have been
  relatively easy to achieve with its well-lit nave and pulpit from which Casaubon might
  speak <a href="image.html?asset=P-217.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-335"></a>. One of its tomb figures might even have been modelled
  on Casaubon himself <a href="image.html?asset=P-218.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-335"></a>. It may have been that budget or logistical constraints, at this late stage in the
  location shoot, mitigated against the filming of these scenes.</p>


<p id="note-336"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">336. Davies portrays Ladislaw's only communication with Dorothea through her 'distressed'
  and 'embarrassed' look as she leaves the church on Casaubon's arm. In Chapter 46 she
  bows to him on her way into church and then with more 'agitation'
  on the way out leaving Ladislaw mortified that he has caused her discomfort and still
  without having seen and talked with her <a href="NO.html#agitation" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-336"></a>. Brympton d'Evercy churchyard would have made an ideal setting for Scene 3/75
  <a href="image.html?asset=P-216.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-336"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-337"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">337. The fact that there was a question mark over these scenes as early as the drafting
  of the Shooting script is evidenced by Davies' notes for Episode 3 (September 1991)
  where his scene list enumerates: ‘29. Ladislaw goes to Lowick Church. (omit?)’.
  Yet they would have served a dramatic function in reinforcing Ladislaw's infatuation,
  between the recent screen encounters with Ladislaw in and around Middlemarch (at the
  Lydgates and <em>The Pioneer</em>) and Scene 4/43 when he returns to Lowick to say goodbye
  to Dorothea. It may also have helped sustain an audience’s faith in his commitment
  to Dorothea despite the ambiguity of his social actions. Instead, the Post-production
  script leaps straight to Scene 3/76 and Dorothea's full realisation of the futile
  nature of Casaubon's research
  <a href="PP.html#futile-realisation" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-337"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-338"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">338. In interview, Lighting cameraman, Brian Tufano explains the different lighting
  techniques he used to obtain the lighting of Casaubon's library as he and Dorothea

<p id="note-339"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">339. Costume designer, Anushia Nieradzik discusses how she gains access to shots of
  interiors and gauges what colours to use for constumes that will tone in with those.
  Here in Casaubon's gloomy library and the darkness and seriouslness of Lowick in general,
  Dorothea
  rarely wears any colours brighter than the petrol-blue of her dress in this scene
  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-85.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-339"></a> <a href="assets/PM-85-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-339"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-339"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-340"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">340. Davies increases the level of melodrama in this scene from the novel through
  his dialogue. Here he implies that Casaubon will demand 'much intensive labour' from
  his young wife both now and after she becomes his widow. In Chapter 48, Casaubon does
  not speak this
  intention to Dorothea - it is only in his thoughts that he will 'demand much labour
  and interest from her' <a href="NO.html#much-labour" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-340"></a>. Susie Conklin (formerly Chapman), in interview, indicates that Anthony Page gave
  the principal actors time on set to grow into their performances
  for intense scenes such as these <a href="assets/I-01-T-07.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-340"></a>
  <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/107" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-340"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-341"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">341. There is a departure here in the Post-production script from the Shooting script.
  In the earlier version Casaubon's notebooks are 'in disarray' and Dorothea asks 'But
  where am I to start?'. Her task is simply to copy out all the marked passages. In
  the Post-production
  script her husband's notebooks are instead 'carefully arranged' and her task is to
  begin the 'condensation' of his notes by marking only the passages he will select
  <a href="PP.html#condensation" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-341"></a>. This is much closer to the process outlined in Chapter 48 <a href="NO.html#mark" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-341"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-342"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">342. Davies appears to have added all these details in the Post-production script,
  as if taken from Casaubon's notebooks. They do not exist in the novel and are references
  to real people and places from Ancient Greece.</p>


<p id="note-343"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">343. Scene 3/77 was cut before the Shooting script but a short follow-on scene in
  the library (Scene 3/76a) is added in the Post-production script to indicate that
  Dorothea has been working on the notebooks all day and long into the evening. This
  adds to the febrile
  intensity between the couple before they go to bed <a href="PP.html#Scene-376a" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-343"></a>. In the novel they work only for two hours and Casaubon instead asks that they take

<p id="note-345"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">345. Davies' annotated page of the Shooting script suggests with a vertical line and
  a question mark next to Casaubon's speech that the wording might need to change <a href="image.html?asset=A-15.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-345"></a> <a href="assets/A-15-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-345"></a>

<p id="note-346"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">346. Brympton D'Evercy in Somerset provided the perfect wall-lined setting for the

<p id="note-349"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">349. Andrew Davies notes in interview that he provided alternative structures for
  both Episode 4 and 5 to settle a debate over plot ordering between himself
  and producer, Louis Marks / script editor, Susie Chapman. Evidence of this may be
  inferred in the reordering of scenes in Episode 4 between the Shooting script and
  the
  Post-production script <a href="image.html?asset=PM-72.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-349"></a> <a href="assets/PM-72-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-349"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-349"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-350"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">350. The unique role played by Susie Chapman through both her contributions to the
  <em>Middlemarch</em> scripts and in liaising between Andrew Davies and director, Anthony Page, is
  acknowledged here by Davies, in interview, when discussing the job of script writer
  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-74.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-350"></a> <a href="assets/PM-74-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-350"></a>

<p id="note-352"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">352. Note that between the Shooting script and the Post-production script, the Agitator
  becomes Tonks and Tonks (the man who
  approaches Ladislaw) becomes Sparks <a href="PP.html#tonks-sparks" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-352"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-353"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">353. A new first speech for the Agitator (Tonks) is inserted at the very start of
  4/1 in the Post-production script, sending the direct
  message that he's campaigning for the vote for more men to gain fairer representation
  in parliament <a href="PP.html#expand-vote" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-353"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-354"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">354. This line from Supporters in the crowd for Tonks is replaced between the Shooting
  script and the Post-production script by another sharp
  interchange between Hawley and the political agitator. This, along with camera shots
  cutting back and forth between them, energises the scene still further.
  <a href="PP.html#have-a-care" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-354"></a></p>


<p id="note-355"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">355. There is a longer commentary on Scene 4/1 where the political agitator comes
  to town, here <a href="CO.html#comment-215" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-355"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-356"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">356. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  46 here <a href="assets/PF-36.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-356"></a>. The narrator opens this chapter by zooming out from her most recent focus
  on Lydgate to national political events - Lord Russell's Reform Bill. Then the narration
  zooms back in to a different location in Middlemarch to pursue this theme through
  Ladislaw and Brooke.</p>


<p id="note-357"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">357. Scene 4/2 is preceded by an establisher in the Post-production script, not present
  in the Shooting script. This depicts the head printer, Jenkins,
  overseeing the handover of copies of <em>The Pioneer</em> for distribution, as Mr Brooke arrives at the office <a href="PP.html#Jenkins" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-357"></a>. Jenkins
  and his fellow minor characters are pictured on this day of the shoot outside the
  Stamford location for <em>The Pioneer</em> in this image <a href="image.html?asset=P-55.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-357"></a>.
  Gerry Scott's design for <em>The Pioneer</em> sign that hangs over the door is shown this sketch <a href="image.html?asset=PM-93.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-357"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-358"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">358. The debate about Reform is continued here by Ladislaw and Brooke from Scene 4/1,
  with Brooke maintaining his characteristic call for moderation and Ladislaw
  arguing that a thorough reform is needed in Britain to avoid the extremity of revolution
  that happened 30 years before in France. Davies stays close here to the dialogue in
  Chapter 46
  of the novel <a href="NO.html#constitution" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-358"></a>. The backdrop for this discussion is captured in a location shot of the newspaper
  office <a href="image.html?asset=P-56.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-358"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-359"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">359. The 'bit of an avalanche' analogy that Ladislaw makes here as part of his argument
  for thorough reform is taken by Davies verbatim from Eliot in Chapter 46.
  <a href="NO.html#bit-avalanche" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-359"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-360"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">360. Davies' Ladislaw reacts more sharply to Brooke's thought about buying him a pocket
  borough than does Eliot's Ladislaw <a href="NO.html#pocket-borough" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-360"></a> He tends to be
  slightly more more politically pragmatic or keeps his thoughts to himself - which
  can be reflected in Eliot's narrative. For example, in Chapter 46, Ladislaw is rather
  flattered that Brooke has said his avalanche
  analogy of reminds him of Edmund Burke's fine speeches and so Ladislaw's risposte
  about pocket boroughs is witty rather than critical. The language of the riposte also
  softens slightly between the
  Shooting script and the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#softened-riposte" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-360"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-361"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">361. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  46 here <a href="assets/PF-37.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-361"></a>. The narrator pauses the action to reflect on the nature of
  Will Ladislaw's dilletanteism and how, almost by chance, he has found a cause in his
  work with Brooke to which he is becoming committed.</p>


<p id="note-362"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">362. Ladislaw's speech here is another indication of the modern-day degree of informality
  that Davies injects into the relationship between Will and Brooke. In the novel Eliot's
  narrator
  breaks off from their debate about reform as Will's thoughts shift to his banishment
  from Lowick <a href="NO.html#thoughts-shift" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-362"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-363"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">363. The Post-production script ends with a formal 'Goodbye' between Ladislaw and
  Brooke that is not present in the Shootng script <a href="PP.html#camera-dwells" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-363"></a>. After this,
  the camera lingers on Ladislaw for a good 10 seconds, as he dwells on Brooke's comment
  about the sadness of the situation at Lowick where the viewer is transported next
  in Scene 4/3.</p>


<p id="note-364"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">364. View the walk-and-talk scene where Lydgate and Farebrother are buttonholed by
  Mr Mawmsey here <a href="assets/F-28.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-364"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-365"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">365. The entrance to Mr Mawmsey's grocer's shop is dressed just as it is presented
  in this location shot as Lydgate and Farebrother walk past it, attracting the master
  grocer's
  attention at the start of this scene <a href="image.html?asset=P-74.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-365"></a>. The interior of Mawmsey's shop which features later, in Scene 4/23, was also modelled
  in great detail by the production design team
  as this plan view demonstrates <a href="image.html?asset=PM-24.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-365"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-366"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">366. Farebrother bids Mawmsey 'Good afternoon', showing common courtesy to the Middlemarch
  tradesperson that Lydgate does not, even though, the viewer soon discovers, he treats
  Mrs Mawmsey. With this, Davies
  also introduces Mawmsey to the viewers and Farebrother to a scene in which he does
  not appear in Chapter 45 of the novel. There, Lydgate is on his own when he talks
  with Mawmsey <a href="NO.html#Lydgate-alone" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-366"></a>. In fact, Mawmsey's
  response to Farebrother in the Post-production script is omitted and instead he immediately
  buttonholes Lydgate <a href="PP.html#buttonholed" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-366"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-367"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">367. Davies' script for most of this scene remains unchanged between the Shooting
  script and the Post-production script, attesting to his skill in both enhancing and
  concising the narrative for this encounter
  in Chapter 45 <a href="NO.html#jocosely" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-367"></a>. Ken Campbell's performance as Mawmsey adds the 'jocosely complimentary' tone of
  Eliot's Mawmsey to the 'grandly confidential' note for Mawmsey in Davies' stage directions

  <a href="PP.html#grandly-confidential" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-367"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-368"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">368. Davies reflects Dr Lydgate's almost flippant tone here to Mawmsey and uses his
  analogy of 'overdosing the king's lieges' directly from Eliot's dialogue in Chapter
  45 <a href="NO.html#overdosing" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-368"></a>. But
  as Eliot asserts, Lydgate does this 'rather thoughtlessly' (p.259) and it leaves Mawmsey
  slightly confused and offended. In the novel his comment also offends his fellow Middlemarch
  medics when relayed to them <a href="NO.html#humbug" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-368"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-369"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">369. As Davies' annotated page of the Shooting script reveals, he felt the ending
  of this scene needed strengthening to show Mawmsey's indignation at Lydgate's 'overdosing'
  comment
  <a href="image.html?asset=A-17.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-369"></a> <a href="assets/A-17-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-369"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-369"></a>. And the
  new line in the Post-production script, spoken to his assistant Atkins, shows his
  solution to this and also perhaps indicates that the grocer is not looking forward
  to bringing the news to his
  wife <a href="PP.html#Mrs-Mawmsey-needs" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-369"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-370"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">370. Farebrother's opening speech in the Shooting script, reminding Lydgate of all
  he has to be thankful for, is omitted from the Post-production script. With this is
  lost the sense that the scene opens in media res after Lydgate has complained to his
  friend.
  Instead the nub of the scene is reached faster - Lydgate is meeting with some 'hostility'
  in the town and his expenditure is exceeding his means <a href="PP.html#hostility" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-370"></a>. Here, near the start of Episode 4, Davies reminds the viewer  that Lydgate faces
  hostility not only because of his new medical
  practices but because he is allied with Bulstrode. This last idea is pursued more
  obviously in Shooting script Scene 4/7b which is subsequently cut completely from
  the Post-production script <a href="SS.html#distance-Bulstrode" target="SS" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-370"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-371"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">371. Davies' annotated page of the Shooting script indicates that he planned to inject
  a phrase into Lydgate's speech here to identify Mawmsey as an exemplar of the Middlemarchers'
  mentality
  towards new things <a href="image.html?asset=A-18.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-371"></a> <a href="assets/A-18-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-371"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-371"></a>.
  No such change appears in the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#Mawmsey-example" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-371"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-372"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">372. These stage directions indicate that both Lydgate and Farebrother acknowlegdge
  the two women. On screen it is only Farebother who turns and tips his hat to them
  when one greets him. He is respected by and respects the
  Middlemarchers. Lydgate carries on talking and looks only at Farebrother. The Shooting
  script stage directions indicate that the women are 'quite clearly gossiping about
  them' and that once the men pass by they 'turn away and continue their
  conversation' <a href="PP.html#gossiping-continues" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-372"></a>. Although this is not as clear in the Post-production script, it is clear in performance.
  These gossips, pictured in this production still, may even overhear Lydgate's thoughts
  on the
  'ignorance and spite' of Middlemarch <a href="image.html?asset=P-93.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-372"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-373"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">373. The final on-screen exchange between Farebrother and Lydgate in this scene is
  altogether less fanciful than it is in the Shooting script. Here, Davies indicates
  Lydgate is still optimistic and dotes on Rosamond. He moves swiftly
  from their financial need to 'cut our coat according to our cloth' to likening his
  wife to Botticelli's naked Venus who 'needs no adornment' at all. In the Post-production
  script, the shorter exchange loses some of Lydgate's optimism and, though he
  seems to take Farebrother's point about not racking up too much debt in Middlemarch,
  his tone is less than convincing <a href="PP.html#take-your-point" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-373"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-374"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">374. There is a longer commentary on Scenes 4/6-4/7a here <a href="CO.html#comment-220" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-374"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-375"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">375. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  44 here <a href="assets/PF-35.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-375"></a>. The narrator explains how the rumour mill in Middlemarch operates in relation to
  Lydgate's new
  methods. The dryly ironic voice is present in the comment that these rumours 'need
  never stop short at the boundary of knowledge' and 'can draw for ever on the vasts
  of ignorance'.</p>


<p id="note-376"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">376. Davies' annotated page of the Shooting script suggest that he felt strongly that
  a 'missing' scene (4/10) should be reinstated here scene. The foot of this page indicates
  that 4/10 had been previously deleted.
  <a href="image.html?asset=A-19.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-376"></a> <a href="assets/A-19-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-376"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-376"></a>. A scene featuring Lydgate's
  help in reviving Dorothea physically and mentally after her fainting episode does
  appear in the Post-production script but not in the form Davies pens on this annotated
  page. For example, it includes his advice that Mrs Casaubon should be able to do
  whatever gives her 'most repose of mind' <a href="PP.html#sal-volatile" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-376"></a>. This is a condensation of a similar incident in Chapter 50 of the novel <a href="NO.html#repose-of-mind" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-376"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-377"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">377. Davies' annotated page of the Shooting script suggests an addition to this scene
  which sees Dorothea imagining the presence of Casaubon in his Lowick library. He asks,
  'Can we just try it?'
  <a href="image.html?asset=A-20.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-377"></a> <a href="assets/A-20-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-377"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-377"></a>. In fact scene 4/15 is extended still further in the
  Post-production script when Dorothea finds a letter addressed to her from Casaubon
  and hears V/Os of their previous painful conversations in the library before seeing
  the vision of him.
  <a href="PP.html#scene-expansion" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-377"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-378"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">378. This location shot of the proofing end of <em>The Pioneer</em> office is the set for this scene. An apprentice printer descends these stairs as
  Lydgate begins his

<p id="note-379"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">379. Davies' annotated page of the Shooting script suggests an addition to this scene
  where Ladislaw wishes he could just leave town but claims there is too much to keep
  him there. <a href="image.html?asset=A-21.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-379"></a>

A slightly abbreviated version of this addition makes it into the Post-production

  script but it has no direct origin in the novel <a href="PP.html#hold-me-here" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-379"></a>.</p>

<p id="note-383"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">383. Scene 4/22 where Brooke and Ladislaw approach Mawmsey's replaces the original
  idea of Mawmsey taking the air outside his shop as Brooke comes to visit in the Shooting
  script (4/23). This image shows the way the street scene leading up
  to Mawmsey's was prepared, including the market stall on the corner that Brooke and
  Ladislaw come around. A Stamford resident, guided by a crew member, is also seen being
  entering the 'Coffee House' adjacent to Mawmsey's <a href="image.html?asset=P-76.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-383"></a>.</p>

<p id="note-387"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">387. Much of Scene 4/30 is subsumed at the start of Scene 4/32 in the Post-production
  script, including the conversation between Sparks and Dagley about who Brooke is,
  where he is from and his status <a href="PP.html#scene-4.30-subsumed" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-387"></a>.
  Instead, in the Post-production script, 4/30 becomes a much simpler establisher for
  the Hustings in the market square <a href="PP.html#Hustings-establisher" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-387"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-388"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">388. As the building used for The White Hart had no balcony, instead the production
  design and build team constructed a wooden hustings platform with a canvas roof. This
  and the hustings scene can be seen taking shape in these location photos:

The final scene ready to shoot with actors, extras and carriages in place in St
  Georges Square, Stamford was made by the cinematography to look much larger on screen

  <a href="image.html?asset=P-109.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-388"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-389"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">389. Production designer, Gerry Scott, explains in interview how she scoped out each
  location to establish the work required to convert it to a heritage drama setting
  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-86.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-389"></a> <a href="assets/pm-86-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-389"></a>

  - visible side-on to the right of this image of the Hustings scene. The relaid 'nineteenth
  century' road surface, covering the tarmac, is another example in the foreground here
  <a href="image.html?asset=P-109.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-389"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-390"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">390. Bulstrode is included in Brooke's entourage in the Shooting script, as he is
  in Chapter 51 of the novel <a href="NO.html#solidity-Bulstrode" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-390"></a>. In the Post-production script, however, he is absent and instead Vincy and Standish
  are
  more promintent <a href="PP.html#Vincy-prominent" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-390"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-391"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">391. Brooke begins to panic about the details of his speech and, despite Ladislaw's
  best efforts to focus him on their 'broad outlines and a 'clear strong message', the
  dialogue conveys that Brooke neither can retain his speech nor knows his
  audience. Some of Brooke's bluster is condensed between the Shooting and Post-production
  scripts to build momentum and also to allow for a short dialogue addition at the end
  of this scene. <a href="PP.html#swept" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-391"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-392"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">392. Davies' annotated page of the Shooting script, for the start of Scene 4/32, suggests
  an addition where Vincy summarises to Brooke, Ladislaw (and viewers) the running order
  for the husting speeches. <a href="image.html?asset=A-22.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-392"></a>
  <a href="assets/A-22-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-392"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-392"></a>. This dialogue is adopted in the Post-production and occurs in motion as Brooke's
  is swept by
  outdoors by his committee.<a href="PP.html#wind-up" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-392"></a>.</p>

<p id="note-394"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">394. Ladislaw's opening speech in the Post-production script is truncated from that
  in the Shooting script <a href="image.html?asset=A-22.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-394"></a> <a href="assets/A-22-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-394"></a>

  script is more
  'self-less'. This script alteration enhances the contrast between his introduction
  and Brooke's more self-centred speech<a href="PP.html#self-less" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-394"></a>. More importantly in adaptation terms, in the novel Ladislaw makes no
  speech at all at the hustings. Brooke's introduction is by 'a political personage
  from Brassing' <a href="NO.html#Brassing" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-394"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-395"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">395. Davies fashions Ladislaw's speeches in Scene 4/32 as a model of rhetoric. He
  moves from the general to the specific, employs rhetorical questions, emphasis and
  repetiton and values his audience. By the
  of his introduction Davies notes in his Stage directions that Ladislaw has the 'bite
  and edge of passion' required for a great orator and as his speech concludes the crowd
  are 'very conscious of their worth' <a href="PP.html#model-of-rhetoric" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-395"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-396"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">396. Ladislaw's penultimate speech is edited out between the Shooting script and the
  Post-production script <a href="PP.html#shortened-rhetoric" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-396"></a>. His effusive comments about Brooke are lost, perhaps because they echo some of the
  ways in which Brooke goes on to
  talks about himself in own opening remarks. Ladislaw understands that less is sometimes
  more.</p>


<p id="note-397"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">397. Davies acknowledges that 'two sherries is a lot' for Brooke, just as in Chapter
  51 Eliot shows Brooke is foolish but also offers sympathy for his nerves and states
  that he is 'an abstemious man' for whom two large sherries in quick succession is
  'a surprise to his
  system' <a href="NO.html#abstemious" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-397"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-398"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">398. The first overt speech by the character Vent, whom Davies refers to in his stage
  directions at the top of Scene 4/32 as 'a little round faced grinning man', is a comical
  'Quaack'. Vent is named by Davies but in the novel remains a disembodied voice that
  distracts the
  crowd at Brooke's expense with his 'Punch-voiced echo'. Vent becomes the voice of
  the effigy that is next unveiled by Hawley's crew. This 'Quaack' is the sound that
  fills the void when Brooke pauses - his mind having gone 'completely blank'<a href="PP.html#Quaack" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-398"></a>. Instead of an
  initial 'Quack', Eliot mentions 'a parrot-like... echo' of Brooke's words that throws
  him further off course <a href="NO.html#parrot-like" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-398"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-399"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">399. When Brooke falters in his speech, Davies' homophonic joke of 'I... I...' and
  'Aye?' for Vent derives from the Shakespearian comic portfolio <a href="PP.html#I-Aye" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-399"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-400"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">400. The effect of Brooke's effigy being raised in the crowd is shown from the side-on
  perspective of the production crew in this on-location image of the Hustings scene
  <a href="image.html?asset=P-06.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-400"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-401"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">401. Trade is the most relevant topic that Brooke has hit on yet but, before he reaches
  that in the Post-production script, he recalls Ladislaw's earlier metaphor that you
  cannot have a 'bit of an avalanche' <a href="PP.html#nonsense-avalanche" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-401"></a>. It sounds nonsensical and
  provides Vent with yet more material with which to parody him. Eliot's narrator tells
  the reader that when Brooke mentions the Baltic, a reference remote from his audience's
  experience, Vent whips up the crowd further and by this point Davies' crowd are also
  'roaring with laughter'
  <a href="NO.html#Baltic" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-401"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-402"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">402. Vent's pun on 'bill' to mean the reckoning rather than the Reform Bill comes
  straight from the novel and leads to the effigy being pelted with eggs with some also
  hitting 'the original' Brooke <a href="NO.html#rotten-eggs" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-402"></a>. In the final producution eggs and tomatoes
  are chiefly aimed at Brooke but the effigy remains unscathed <a href="PP.html#effigy-unscathed" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-402"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-403"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">403. There is a longer commentary on Scenes 4/32-32a here <a href="CO.html#comment-235" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-403"></a>. Scene 4/32a only appears in the Post-Production script<a href="PP.html#scene-42a" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-403"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-404"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">404. This short scene rounding off the Hustings sequence, only appears in the Post-production
  script. It portrays both Brooke's belief that this is merely a set back and Ladislaw's
  despair at his patron's lack of sense. The reference for this scene comes from the
  end of Chapter 51
  <a href="NO.html#too-bad" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-404"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-405"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">405. Scene 4/34 reappears in the Post-production script to indicate Mr Brooke's poor
  show at the hustings is the cause of gossip in the streets of Middlemarch <a href="PP.html#new-scene-434" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-405"></a>. He comes down the hill and rounds the corner to <em>The Pioneer</em> office. This location shot shows the Stamford
  property used for the newspaper office <a href="image.html?asset=P-225.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-405"></a>. Brooke next appears standing in the office at the start of 4/35 <a href="PP.html#Brooke-waits" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-405"></a> whereas in the Shooting script he enters through the front door as he did in Scene
  4.2. This change could have also been made to inject visual variety into
  <em>The Pioneer</em> scenes in Episode 4.

<p id="note-406"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">406. Davies' notes on his annotated Shooting script for Scene 4/38, underline two

<p id="note-407"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">407. Scene 4/43, where Dorothea and Ladislaw misunderstand one another over the reasons

<p id="note-408"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">408. Davies annotates this speech in the Shooting script to delete Dorothea's statement
  about Ladislaw's 'many talents' <a href="image.html?asset=A-24.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-408"></a> <a href="assets/A-24-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-408"></a>

  sentence
  has been cut <a href="PP.html#Besides" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-408"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-409"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">409. Davies reverses two parts of Dorothea's speech from the novel here for dramatic
  effect <a href="NO.html#despise-women" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-409"></a>. By ending on 'long to speak' the tension rises, encouraging an expectation that
  she will go on reveal her feelings. There is a small correction to the Shooting script
  made by Andrew Davies
  but with no defintive change to meaning <a href="image.html?asset=A-25.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-409"></a> <a href="assets/A-25-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-409"></a>

<p id="note-410"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">410. There is a longer commentary on Scene 4/43 here <a href="CO.html#comment-240" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-410"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-411"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">411. Davies' annotated Shooting script, shows a pragmatic change to Raffles' penultimate
  speech in Scene 4/50. The screenwriter realises that Raffles cannot address Caleb
  as 'Mr Garth' as he has not yet been introduced and so changes it to 'Good evening,
  sir' <a href="image.html?asset=A-26.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-411"></a>
  <a href="assets/A-26-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-411"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-411"></a>. This in fact becomes his final speech in the Post-production script equivalent,
  Scene 4/50b <a href="PP.html#Sir" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-411"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-412"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">412. Much of this speech is taken verbatim from Raffles' words to Bulstrode in Chapter
  53 once they are alone: the insinuating references to Bulstrode now being a 'country
  squire', to his first wife being 'dead a long while' and to Nick looking 'very pale
  and pasty' <a href="NO.html#country-squire" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-412"></a>. These
  details are omitted however from the Post-production script - in all likelihood because
  similar information is conveyed by Raffles in Scene 4/51 <a href="PP.html#scene-4.51" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-412"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-413"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">413. Raffles' first visit to Stone Court to blackmail Bulstrode can be viewed here
  <a href="assets/F-32.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-413"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-414"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">414. Raflles' more overt questioning in front of Harriet of Bultrode's explanation
  of his business at Stone Court is replaced in the
  Post-production script with his subtler but more insinuating farewell comment to her
  that he could tell her a 'tale or two' of Nick's former life in London
  <a href="PP.html#tale-or-two" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-414"></a>. In Chapter 53 of the novel, Mrs Bulstrode is not present at all. Bulstrode installs
  Raffles at Stone Court for the night where Mrs Abel,
  Rigg's housekeeper, is still in residence. The Bulstrodes' main home is still at the
  Shrubs in Middlemarch at this point <a href="NO.html#the-Shrubs" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-414"></a>. Davies brings
  their residence at Stone Court forward to increase the jeopardy of Raffles' presence.</p>


<p id="note-415"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">415. This speech remains unchanged between the Shooting script and the Post-production
  script but Andrew Davies' annotations to the former indicate
  that he was concerned it might be laying the story of Bulstrode's past too heavily
  'on the line' <a href="image.html?asset=A-27.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-415"></a> <a href="assets/A-27-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-415"></a>
  <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-415"></a>. His concerns may have been due to
  source of this speech being taken from Chapter 61 of the novel where Ladislaw questions
  Bulstrode about the business he and his first wife ran amidst 'thieves and
  convicts' <a href="NO.html#thieves" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-415"></a>. This contrasts with much of the dialogue for the remainder of the scene which is
  rooted in Chapter 53 where Raffles first appears
  at Stone Court <a href="NO.html#Raffles-first-StoneCourt" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-415"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-416"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">416. Davies sets most of the conversation that reveals Bulstrode's backstory and Raffles's
  intention to blackmail him in this evening scene. By contrast,
  in the novel, Eliot keeps the evening conversation short so that Bulstrode can ruminate
  on Raffles during his ride home to Middlemarch. The greater part of their dialogue

  happens back at Stone Court early the next morning <a href="NO.html#early-morning" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-416"></a>. Davies' rearrangement of these conversations also allows for further involvement
  of
  Harriet in the night-time scene (Sc 4/54) where she wakes to find Bulstrode praying
  for guidance on what to do about Raffles <a href="PP.html#Harriet-awakes" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-416"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-417"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">417. Raffles' tone, described in Chapter 53 as 'a peculiar mixutre of joviality and
  sneering' is implied in this line of dialogue by Davies and perfectly
  delivered by John Savident in performance <a href="NO.html#jovial-sneering" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-417"></a>. It is, in part, why Eliot's narrator tells readers that Bulstrode determines to
  wait until
  Raffles was 'quite sober before he spent more words upon him'. Instead, Davies' Bulstrode
  deals with Raffles in his inebriated state <a href="PP.html#inebriated" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-417"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-418"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">418. Bulstrode's comment about a man overreaching himself, which originates from the
  novel, shows that he does not yet appreciate the irony of his own position
  in Middlemarch <a href="NO.html#overreach" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-418"></a>. Raffles is quick to show him this irony with his response in the Shooting script,
  which Eliot does not allow him. This response is
  extended by Davies, using material from a later speech in the Post-production script
  to reveal the story of how Bulstrode cheated his step-daughter out of her inheritance
  and how she died penniless <a href="PP.html#penniless" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-418"></a>.
  In the final production this provokes an expression of shock on Bulstrode's face that
  might imply he did not know this or that he now realises the full implications of
  Raffles' knowledge.
  In the novel, Raffles himself does not know Sarah's ultimate fate. That is revealed
  earlier to the reader by Ladislaw (who Davies chooses not to relate to the Bulstrode-Raffles
  plot in his adaptation).
  Only at the end of Chapter 53, after Bulstrode departs, does Raffles remember that
  Sarah's married name was Ladislaw <a href="NO.html#Sarah-Ladislaw" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-418"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-419"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">419. In the Shooting script, Raffles reveals what he wants from Bulstrode before he
  goes to bed; in the Post-production script, news of the 'hundreds' he demands
  of Bulstrode's 'thousands and thousands' is delayed for their morning conversation,
  sustaining the dramatic tension of this plot line.<a href="PP.html#hundreds" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-419"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-420"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">420. Davies' uncanny skill for alighting on a word or phrase from the source text
  he is adapting to perfectly reflect its time frame is exemplified here in Raffles'
  'pick up my
  portmanteau at the turnpike'. This originates late in Chapter 53 <a href="NO.html#portmanteau" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-420"></a> but the fact that the portmanteau is at the turnpike comes from earlier in this chapter

  <a href="NO.html#turnpike" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-420"></a>. The fact that these words were already old-fashioned in Eliot's time and that she
  was probably using them to give her historical novel a flavour
  of the 1830s is not lost on Davies. This line persists in the Post-production script
  in Scene 4/56 <a href="PP.html#pick-turnpike" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-420"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-421"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">421. Davies' annotated page, places a question mark over the last line of Raffles
  speech where he poses the question to Bulstrode 'But for how long, eh?' will a payment
  keep him away
  <a href="image.html?asset=A-28.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-421"></a> <a href="assets/A-28-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-421"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-421"></a>. By the
  time of the Post-production script, these last two sentences have been cut .<a href="PP.html#how-long-eh" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-421"></a> </p>


<p id="note-422"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">422. There is a longer commentary on Scene 4/51 here <a href="CO.html#comment-245" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-422"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-423"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">423. This short night-time scene, which is of Davies' invention, foregrounds Bulstrode's
  moral self-examination over his former life and dealings with Raffles, which Eliot's

  narrative offers in Chapter 53 <a href="NO.html#peturbation" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-423"></a>. The scene also shows Mrs Bulstrode is alert to her husband's perturbation as she
  watches him side-lit by the fire, wringing his
  hands <a href="PP.html#lit-by-fire" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-423"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-424"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">424. This establishing scene signalling both the dawning of a new day at Stone Court
  and Raffles' uncouth behaviour, which would set alarm bells ringing in Middlemarch
  about Bulstrode if he
  were to remain in town, disappears between the Shooting script and the Post-production
  script <a href="PP.html#cut-Sc-455" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-424"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-425"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">425. The improvement made between Scene 4/56 in the Shooting script and the same scene
  in the Post-production script is marked. By withholding the details of Raffles'
  blackmail demand until the latter, Davies strengthens the dramatic effect and rids
  the scene of the less successful dialogue where Raffles laughs at how pale Bulstrode
  is looking. The blocking
  of the scene also changes dramatically: in the Shooting script Raffles stands, as
  if to take control of the situation while Bulstrode is seated; in the Post-production
  script, Bulstrode stands
  in an attempt to keep control but the seated Raffles, chinking his teacup with his
  spoon, retains the initiative as he makes his demands with an uneven toothy grin <a href="PP.html#seated-Raffles" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-425"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-426"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">426. The Shooting script ends this scene with Bulstrode extracting an assurance from
  Raffles that he will not stretch his 'patience too far'. Davies' intervening query
  in an annotation
  on the Shooting script suggests an end to 4/56 where Raffles leaves Stone Court waving
  rather impudently to Bulstrode <a href="image.html?asset=A-29.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-426"></a> <a href="assets/A-29-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-426"></a>

  end of Chapter 53, where
  Bultrode is much less certain that Raffles will not reappear <a href="PP.html#measly" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-426"></a>. He refers to Raffles as an 'ugly black spot' that 'might become inseparable even
  from the vision of his own hearth' <a href="NO.html#black-spot" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-426"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-427"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">427. The end of Scene 4/56 corresponds with the end of Book 5 (Ch.53) of the novel
  <a href="NO.html#end-of-book-5" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-427"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-428"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">428. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  58 here <a href="assets/PF-39.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-428"></a>. The narrator's close observation spells out a nuance of Rosamond's
  character, through her choice to ride out a second time on Captain Lydgate's grey.
  She opts for self-gratification that will bring her close to her 'dreams before marriage'
  over the possible consequences for her unborn child. But
  there is also empathy embedded here in the narration.</p>


<p id="note-429"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">429. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  58 here <a href="assets/PF-40.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-429"></a>. Moving from the generalising comment that 'men' have 'numerous strands of
  experience lying side by side and never compare them with each other', the narrator
  meditates on Lydgate' specific blindness to how he reaches his financial impasse.

<p id="note-430"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">430. Andrew Davies uses the cover of the Episode 5 Shooting script to record the main
  changes he proposes to make: in this case he queries Rosamond's reference to visiting
  Quallingham in Scene 5/35 (p.5/60)
  when the scene where this happens (3/44) has been cut from the Shooting script. This
  scene was later reinstated during the Block 3 shoot of August 1993 <a href="PP.html#Rosys-visit" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-430"></a>. He also notes to look again at script

<p id="note-432"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">432. The exterior location (of the screened version) for Fred and Farebrother's conversation

  in Somerset - captured in this image
  <a href="image.html?asset=P-221.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-432"></a>. The original intention in the Shooting script was for the setting to be the interior
  of Lowick parsonage and for Farebrother to be unpackng his books in his new home but,
  pehaps due to
  limitations in the interiors available at this locaation, this changed to the sunlit
  exterior of the churchyard <a href="PP.html#sunlit-exterior" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-432"></a>.</p>

<p id="note-434"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">434. This annotated script page reveals that Andrew Davies adds a note of emphasis
  to Farebrother's entreaty on Fred's behalf just by inserting the word 'other' into
  'some way' in this speech
  <a href="image.html?asset=A-31.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-434"></a> <a href="assets/A-31-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-434"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-434"></a> <a href="PP.html#some-other-way" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-434"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-435"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">435. This first speech of Dorothea's is taken from some speech reported by Caleb Garth
  to Susan. He tells her in Chapter 46 that Dorothea's view of doing good work that
  can be reflected up on in old age is a thought that he
  also had when a young man <a href="NO.html#healthy-kind" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-435"></a>. Davies himself cuts this direct reference from the novel in his annotations to the

<p id="note-436"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">436. In the annotations to this script page, Andrew Davies rings some text and notes
  'Kill this'. These opening speeches are indeed cut from the Post-production script
  and the action starts in media res <a href="PP.html#site-the-cottages" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-436"></a>.
  Some of Dorothea's omitted sentiments about not minding the expense of the cottages

  56 here <a href="assets/PF-38.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-437"></a>. In comic-ironic mode, the narrator introduces the objections of
  the women and landowners of the Middlemarch hundred to the sale of land to railway
  companies. Rail travel might be 'presumptuous and dangerous' but it is also recognised
  as highly profitable by those with land to sell.</p>

<p id="note-439"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">439. In interview, Lighting cameraman Brian Tufano explains how 5/15-5/20 was one
  of the few scene sequences that he felt needed to be storyboarded. He outlines multiple
  reasons for this including the fact
  that there was much ground to be covered and that it involved a fight scene <a href="image.html?asset=PM-97.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-439"></a> <a href="assets/PM-97-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-439"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-439"></a>.</p>

<p id="note-441"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">441. An establishing shot of the Garth's home is inserted in the Post-production script
  just before Scene 5/21 <a href="PP.html#Garth-location" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-441"></a>. In the earlier script this was not necessary as the story
  flowed chronologically from 5/20 where Fred and Garth talk about his future. Contrastingly,
  in the Post-Production script 5/21 is preceded by 5/24 where Fred tells Mr Vincy he
  does not wish to enter the clergy. The location for
  the Garth's residence with its sloping roofline was situated in rural Northamptonshire

<p id="note-443"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">443. In his annotations to the Shooting script, Davies circles the last sentence of
  Mrs Cadwallader's speech about 'we English' and 'open carriages' as if he is considering
  cutting this. The sentence is retained
  in the Post-production script and the moments it takes up are used by Aubrey to show
  Dorothea's silent anger towards Mrs Cadwallader. The term 'we English' also reminds
  the viewer of the xenophobic attitudes witnessed
  in this landed class during the preceding scene <a href="image.html?asset=A-33.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-443"></a> <a href="assets/A-33-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-443"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-443"></a>.</p>

<p id="note-452"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">452. Andrew Davies uses the cover of the Episode 6 Shooting script to record the main

  that Lydgate is getting further into debt, is a
  'bit too much', and if 6/44 (p.6/68), where Dorothea's cottage plans have to be ditched
  due to their excessive cost, is 'too much of a let down'. He also notes to look again

<p id="note-456"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">456. The location for Lydgate's dispensing office at the new Fever Hospital was an

  <a href="image.html?asset=A-35.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-461"></a> <a href="assets/A-35-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-461"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-461"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-462"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">462. View Scenes 6/36-38 here, where Lydgate reacts to Raffles' death, the news becomes
  known in Middlemarch and spreads to the Green Dragon <a href="assets/F-40.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-462"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-463"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">463. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  71 here <a href="assets/PF-45.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-463"></a>. The rumour mill of Middlemarch is in operation again. The narrator shows how a group
  including
  Bambridge and Hopkins grows at the Green Dragon as a link between Raffles' illness
  and death is established with Bulstrode and the news travels fast.</p>


<p id="note-464"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">464. There is a longer commentary on Scenes 6/36-38 and Scenes 6/39a to 6/41 in the
  Shooting script here <a href="CO.html#comment-285" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-464"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-465"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">465. The Production schedule indicates that Scene 6/42 was shot in Stamford on 9 August
  1993 but that it did not make the final cut. It was possibly omitted to ensure the
  episode was exactly the correct length <a href="PP.html#no-scene-6.42" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-465"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-466"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">466. This short scene is another where Lydgate is openly gossiped about by the wider
  community of Middlemarch - a prominent strand in the novel which Davies seeks to represent.
  Its loss from the screened version weakens
  this representation. In the novel, Lydgate and Bulstrode do meet just outside the
  hospital but their conversation is not recorded and Bulstrode's dialogue is taken
  by Davies from a prior conversation with Harriet Bulstrode
  about their future plans <a href="NO.html#Cheltenham" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-466"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-467"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">467. Scene 6/43 was shot at Browne's Hospital on the penultimate day of filming in
  Stamford - 12 August 1993 - before the production moved to Yeovil (Lowick). A handdrawn
  image on the front of the Block 3 Production schedule
  (4 July-26 August) shows crew members queuing up to buy their own crosses, signalling
  that the location filming had been a long haul <a href="image.html?asset=PM-92.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-467"></a>. It was unusual for cast and crew to be on location for so long.
  Television drama filming had been traditionally more studio-based.</p>


<p id="note-468"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">468. Davies annotates this page of the Shooting script to indicate 'This scene is
  no good'. However, a better use for this scene is found by moving it forward in Episode
  6 of the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#both-failing" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-468"></a>,
  so that Dorothea's plans and Lydgate's domestic situation are both shown to be failing
  at the start of this final episode <a href="image.html?asset=A-36.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-468"></a> <a href="assets/A-36-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-468"></a>

<p id="note-469"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">469. The end of Scene 6/45 corresponds with the end of Book 7 (Ch.71) of the novel
  <a href="NO.html#end-of-book-7" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-469"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-470"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">470. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  74 here <a href="assets/PF-46.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-470"></a>. The narrator comes close to Harriet Bulstrode's consciousness as the character determines
  to help
  her spouse bear his burden of shame. The symbolism of her changing into a plain dress
  and their wordless acknowledgement of how their life has changee is sensitively conveyed
  through the narration.</p>


<p id="note-471"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">471. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  75 here <a href="assets/PF-47.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-471"></a>. The narrator relays that Rosamond is developing new fantasies for her enjoyment,
  this time based on
  romantic ideas around Will Ladislaw, instead of focusing on the realities of her life.
  Instead she imagines her future life of 'interesting scenes'.</p>


<p id="note-472"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">472. The scene where Dorothea offers to help Lydgate and promises to visit and speak
  with Rosamond can be viewed here <a href="assets/F-41.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-472"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-473"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">473. The annotated Shooting script page for the opening of Scene 6/61 makes two cuts
  to Dorothea's speeches to ensure she does not come across as too 'self-pitying' or
  too clever for clever's sake: one person 'quoting Vesalius is quite enough'. These
  changes are carried
  through in the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#cut-Vesalius" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-473"></a> <a href="image.html?asset=A-37.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-473"></a> <a href="assets/A-37-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-473"></a>
  <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-473"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-474"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">474. Davies seeks to make further cuts to speeches in scene 6/61 which he sees as
  either too wordy or weakening 'the spine of the scene' <a href="image.html?asset=A-38.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-474"></a> <a href="assets/A-38-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-474"></a>
  <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-474"></a>. In fact, both cuts are rejected and these speeches remain unchanged in the Post-production
  script <a href="PP.html#marriage-bond" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-474"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-475"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">475. The cuts that Davies wishes to make from the continuing debate between Dorothea
  and Lydgate about his decision to leave Middlemarch are again resisted <a href="image.html?asset=A-39.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-475"></a> <a href="assets/A-39-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-475"></a>
  <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-475"></a>. This dialogue remains unchanged in the Post-production script. In fact, another
  request is added by Lydgate that Dorothea will help to clear his name with Farebrother

  <a href="PP.html#clear-Farebrother" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-475"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-476"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">476. It is at this point in the Post-production script that the conversation between
  Dorothea and Lydgate moves outdoors at Lowick to form Scene 1/61a <a href="PP.html#scene-1.61a" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-476"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-477"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">477. Davies re-situates one of Eliot's renowned images, delivered by her narrator
  in Chapter 20, in Dorothea's lines. She shares with Lydgate the image of the muffled
  cry which lies 'on the other side of silence'. In the novel it is
  Dorothea's sadness at the reality of her married life that prompts the image <a href="NO.html#other-side-of-silence" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-477"></a>. In the Shooting script it appears as Dorothea consoles Lydgate after his own trials,
  close to the end of the plot. In the Post-production
  script, the image becomes the focal point of 6/61a - a short added scene where Dorothea
  walks Lydgate to the stables <a href="PP.html#muffled-cry" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-477"></a>. In interview, Davies talks about the genuine need to retain some of Eliot's greatest
  lines <a href="image.html?asset=PM-75.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-477"></a>
  <a href="assets/PM-75-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-477"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-477"></a> but also insists that, for dramaturgical reasons, it is vital to resist actors' wishes
  to reclaim too much material from the novel
  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-73.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-477"></a> <a href="assets/PM-73-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-477"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-477"></a>.
  Susie Conklin (then Chapman) concurs with Davies that screenwriting frees the text
  from the narration to bring the story closer to the viewer <a href="assets/I-01-T-06.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-477"></a>
  <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/104" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-477"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-478"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">478. The last exchanges in this dialogue are adapted slightly in the Post-production
  script <a href="PP.html#may-I-call" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-478"></a>. This scene closes with Dorothea asking if she may visit Rosamond but these lines
  are cut from the on-screen version
  because Lydgate has already asked if she would call on his wife at the end of 1/61.
  Instead, both Lydgate and the audience are left to ponder the image of the 'muffled
  cry... on the other side of silence' as the two actors walk out of frame.</p>


<p id="note-479"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">479. Davies' annotated Shooting script page ends this scene with the handwritten direction
  for Dorothea to 'finish strong, + confident. An angel', intending for Dorothea's growing
  confidence to come through <a href="image.html?asset=A-40.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-479"></a>
  <a href="assets/A-40-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-479"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-479"></a>. Instead her 'rather shy tremulous smille is retained where this dialogue falls in

  Scene 6/61a of the Post-production script <a href="PP.html#tremulous" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-479"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-480"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">480. There is a longer commentary on Scene 6/61 in the Shooting script here <a href="CO.html#comment-290" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-480"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-481"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">481. The annotated script page for Scene 6/66 in the Shooting script reveals Davies'
  addition to ramp up the melodrama between Ladislaw and Rosamond. It shows Will's strength
  of feeling which Rosamond has completely misjudged before he collects himself
  <a href="image.html?asset=A-41.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-481"></a> <a href="assets/A-41-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-481"></a> <a href="https://specialcollections.catalogue.dmu.ac.uk/records/D/061/A/043/A" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-481"></a>. In fact, this scene is cut in its entirety from the Post-production script
  <a href="PP.html#Scene-6.66-cut" target="PP" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-481"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-482"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">482. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  76 here <a href="assets/PF-48.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-482"></a>. The narrator conveys Dorothea's ardent will to do good for the benefit of others
  powerfully as something that
  haunts her 'like a passion'. It defies the conventions of her 'youth and sex'.</p>


<p id="note-483"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">483. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  80 here <a href="assets/PF-49.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-483"></a>. Dorothea's night of extreme sorrow and disappointment over Ladislaw, after she discovers
  him with Rosamond, is
  depicted as if she is weathering a storm of emotion. She runs through all the feelings
  she has held for Ladislaw, seeks some distance from them and then awakes to the calm
  of the dawn light.</p>


<p id="note-484"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">484. View Scenes 6/71-2 and 6/77 here, where Dorothea rises to a balmy morning and
  then visits Rosamond to speak of marriage <a href="assets/F-42.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-484"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-485"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">485. There is a longer commentary on Scenes 6/71-2 and Scene 6/77 in the Shooting
  script here <a href="CO.html#comment-295" target="CO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-485"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-486"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">486. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  81 here <a href="assets/PF-50.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-486"></a>. This culmination in the narration captures the moment between Dorothea and Rosamond
  where, from their different
  perspectives they understand one another's pain.</p>


<p id="note-487"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">487. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from Chapter
  85 here <a href="assets/PF-51.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-487"></a>. A telling quotation from Bunyan's <em>Pilgrim's Progress</em> forms the epigraph which opens
  this chapter dealing with Bulstrode's wish to make amends to his wife's family. He
  views himself as judged guilty 'for not being the man he professed to be'.</p>


<p id="note-488"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">488. The final scenes where Dorothea discusses her future with Celia and then a narrator
  reveals how things turn out for the three central couples can be viewed here <a href="assets/F-43.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-488"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-489"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">489. The end of Scene 6/85 corresponds with the end of Book 8 (Ch.86) of the novel
  <a href="NO.html#end-of-book-8" target="NO" title="internal cross-reference"><img src="interlink-icon.png" alt="internal link from note-489"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-490"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">490. Andrew Davies explains in a 1993 interview how at the time of speaking he did
  not know what visuals would play beneath 'George Eliot's voice' which he deemed the
  best vehicle for relaying the fates of her characters at the conclusion of his adaptation

  <a href="image.html?asset=PM-76.png" target="_blank" title="link to picture"><img src="camera-icon.jpg" alt="link to picture for note-490"></a> <a href="assets/PM-76-ts.html" target="_blank" title="link to text"><img src="text-icon.png" class="outlined" alt="link to text for note-490"></a> <a href="http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceArchive/110008677" target="_blank" title="link to metadata"><img src="tag-icon.png" alt="link to metadata for note-490"></a>.</p>


<p id="note-491"><img src="arrow bullet point-icon.png" alt="bullet point icon">491. There is an audio clip illustrating an aspect of Eliot's narration from the Finale
  here <a href="assets/PF-52.mp4" target="_blank" title="link to video"><img src="video-icon.png" alt="link to video for note-491"></a>. The narrator reflects on the 'after-years' of her heroine in these three short extracts
  from the Finale.</p>
